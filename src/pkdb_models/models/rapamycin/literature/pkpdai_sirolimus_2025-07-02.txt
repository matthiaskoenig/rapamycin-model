TI  - Pharmacokinetic interaction between single oral doses of diltiazem and sirolimus 
      in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 32-40
AB  - AIM AND BACKGROUND: The pharmacokinetic interaction between sirolimus, a 
      macrolide immunosuppressant metabolized by CYP3A4, and the calcium channel 
      blocker diltiazem was studied in 18 healthy subjects. Several clinically 
      important interactions have previously been reported for other immunosuppressive 
      drugs that are metabolized by the same enzyme and for calcium antagonists. 
      METHODS: Healthy subjects who were 20 to 43 years old participated in an open, 
      three-period, randomized, crossover study of the pharmacokinetics of a single 
      10-mg oral dose of sirolimus, a single oral 120-mg dose of diltiazem, and the two 
      drugs given together. The three study periods were separated by a 21-day washout 
      phase. RESULTS: The geometric mean (90% confidence interval) whole blood 
      sirolimus area under the plasma concentration time-curve increased 60% (35%-90%), 
      from 736 to 1178 ng x h/mL, and maximum concentration increased 43% (14%-81%), 
      from 67 to 96 ng/mL, with diltiazem coadministration, whereas the mean 
      elimination half-life of sirolimus decreased slightly, from 79 to 67 hours. 
      Apparent oral clearance and volume of distribution of sirolimus decreased with 
      38% and 45%, respectively, when sirolimus was given with diltiazem. The plasma 
      maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of 
      diltiazem, desacetyldiltiazem, and desmethyldiltiazem were unchanged after 
      coadministration of sirolimus, and no potentiation of the effects of diltiazem on 
      diastolic or systolic blood pressure or on the electrocardiographic parameters 
      was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose diltiazem coadministration leads to higher 
      sirolimus exposure, presumably by inhibition of the first-pass metabolism of 
      sirolimus. Because of the pronounced intersubject variability in the extent of 
      the sirolimus-diltiazem interaction, whole blood sirolimus concentrations should 
      be monitored closely in patients treated with the two drugs.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of prednisolone during administration of sirolimus in patients 
      with renal transplants.
PG  - 1100-6
AB  - The pharmacokinetic interaction of multiple oral doses of sirolimus (rapamycin) 
      and prednisone were evaluated in 40 stable patients with renal transplants 
      receiving concomitant multiple doses of cyclosporine. Nine sirolimus dosage 
      levels from 1 mg/m2/day to 13 mg/m2/day were studied and compared with placebo. 
      Plasma concentrations of prednisone, prednisolone, and cortisol were measured by 
      high-performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by noncompartmental methods. 
      Mean pharmacokinetic values of prednisolone found before sirolimus administration 
      were as follows: peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 187 ng/mL; time to peak 
      plasma concentration (tmax) was 2.03 hours; rate of reaching peak plasma 
      concentration (Cmax divided by the area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) 
      was 0.149 hour-1; terminal half-life (t1/2) was 3.60 hours; AUC was 1206 
      ng.hour/mL; and apparent clearance (Cl/F) was 0.094 L/hour/kg. During the 2 weeks 
      of concomitant administration, prednisolone elimination decreased in relation to 
      sirolimus dosages. These changes were modest, with mean increases of 18% in Cmax 
      and 27% in t1/2 and mean decreases of 27% in Cl/F for the groups receiving 6 
      mg/m2/day to 13 mg/m2/day. Most patients initially had plasma cortisol 
      concentrations indicative of adrenal suppression. With sirolimus treatment, the 
      Cmax of cortisol did not decrease further, but the AUC (8:00 AM-8:00 PM) values 
      were significantly lower, independent of sirolimus exposure. The AUC for 
      cyclosporine did not correlate with sirolimus and prednisolone exposure. A 2-week 
      course of sirolimus showed a slight pharmacokinetic interaction between sirolimus 
      and prednisolone/prednisone/cortisol in stable patients with renal transplants.

TI  - A phase I study evaluating the effect of everolimus on the pharmacokinetics of 
      midazolam in healthy subjects.
PG  - 444-50
LID - 10.1002/jcph.7 [doi]
AB  - The selective mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus has 
      demonstrated competitive inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) 3A4 in vitro; 
      however, its influence on CYP3A4 activity in humans is unknown. This study 
      examined the influence of everolimus on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a 
      sensitive CYP3A4/5 substrate, and its 1-hydroxy metabolite in 25 healthy male 
      subjects. Compared with administration of oral midazolam 4 mg/day alone, 
      coadministration with everolimus 10 mg/day increased the midazolam maximum plasma 
      concentration (C(max)) by 25% and the area under the plasma concentration-time 
      curve (AUC) by 30%. The C(max) and AUC of 1-hydroxymidazolam increased by 20% and 
      25%, respectively. Concomitant administration of everolimus with midazolam did 
      not change the midazolam metabolic ratio (i.e., the ratio of 1-hydroxymidazolam 
      AUC to midazolam AUC) or the midazolam or 1-hydroxymidazolam terminal half-lives 
      (geometric mean ratios for midazolam + everolimus vs. midazolam alone of 0.96, 
      1.03, and 1.06, respectively). These results suggest everolimus may affect the 
      bioavailability, but not the systemic clearance, of orally coadministered CYP3A4 
      substrate drugs.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in stable renal transplant patients after multiple 
      oral dose administration.
PG  - 405-15
AB  - In this 2-week, ascending dose study, the pharmacokinetic activity of sirolimus 
      was examined in 40 stable renal transplant patients treated with cyclosporine and 
      prednisone. Nine dose levels (range, 0.5-6.5 mg/m2/12 hr) of sirolimus were 
      studied in a parallel design. Mean values for the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
      sirolimus calculated in all dose groups were as follows: time to peak blood 
      concentration, 1.4 +/- 1.2 hours; terminal half-life, 62 +/- 16 hours; oral dose 
      clearance, 208 +/- 95 mL/h/kg; apparent oral steady-state volume of distribution, 
      12 +/- 5 L/kg; and blood/plasma ratio, 38 +/- 13. The intersubject variabilities 
      in dose clearance, steady-state volume of distribution, and blood/plasma ratio 
      were 4.5-fold. Preliminary assessments suggests linear dose proportionality. An 
      excellent correlation existed between area under the concentration-time curve and 
      trough blood concentration at steady state. Sirolimus did not produce any 
      significant changes in area under the concentration-time curve of cyclosporine. 
      Preliminary analysis suggested that values for the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
      sirolimus vary among races (black versus nonblack) but not among genders.

TI  - Comparative bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of sirolimus tablets in healthy 
      Chinese volunteers.
PG  - 816-22
LID - 10.5414/CP201832 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although sirolimus tablets and oral solutions have been used in 
      clinical practice, no study has been reported on the pharmacokinetics and 
      bioavailability of a single-dose of sirolimus tablets in healthy Chinese 
      volunteers. The purpose of this study was to compare the bioavailability and 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of two different 1-mg sirolimus tablets in 
      healthy Chinese male volunteers and evaluate whether a generic tablet of 
      sirolimus meets the criteria for bioequivalence from the State Food and Drug 
      Administration (SFDA) of China when compared with a reference product. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: A total of 24 healthy Chinese volunteers was eligible for this 6 mg 
      single dose, randomized-sequence, open-label, 2-period crossover study. Blood 
      samples were collected before dosing and at 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 
      8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168, 216, and 264 hours after dosing. Whole blood 
      sirolimus concentration was analyzed by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem 
      mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. Pharmacokinetic properties of sirolimus were 
      assessed using noncompartmental analysis. RESULTS: The mean (range) Cmax values 
      of the test and the reference were 15.25 (8.48 - 24.40) and 13.43 (7.90 - 22.90) 
      ng/ml; AUC0-t values were 475.65 (293.33 - 1049.86) and 451.96 (221.52 - 809.11) 
      ng/h/ml. The medians (range) tmax values were 2.0 (1.0 - 8.0) and 2.0 (1.0 - 8.0) 
      hours, respectively. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratios of Cmax, 
      AUC0-264, and AUC0-∞ were 103.7% to 124.4%, 97.5% to 113.6%, and 98.0% to 114.8%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: In this single-dose crossover study the test sirolimus 
      tablets met the criteria for bioequivalence in terms of both rate and extent. 
      Each sirolimus formulation was well tolerated during the study.

TI  - Effects of oral posaconazole on the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus.
PG  - 701-7
LID - 10.1185/03007990802644209 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Azole antifungal agents are often coadministered with 
      immunosuppressants to recipients of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell 
      transplants. Posaconazole, an extended-spectrum triazole, is an inhibitor of the 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme CYP3A4, and sirolimus, an immunosuppressant, is a 
      substrate of the enzyme. We evaluated the effects of posaconazole on sirolimus 
      pharmacokinetics in an open-label, multiperiod, drug-interaction study. METHODS: 
      Twelve healthy subjects received one dose of sirolimus 2 mg on day 1. After a 
      28-day washout period, subjects received posaconazole 400 mg bid for 16 days (to 
      day 45). On day 36, sirolimus 2 mg and posaconazole 400 mg were coadministered. 
      Blood samples to determine sirolimus plasma concentrations were collected up to 
      216 hours post dose on days 1 and 36 and plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      calculated. Drug interactions were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance. 
      Mean (% coefficient of variation) maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area 
      under the curve (AUC) of sirolimus at day 1 were 4.9 ng/mL (38) and 145 h x ng/mL 
      (45), respectively. RESULTS: Coadministration with posaconazole increased 
      sirolimus C(max) and AUC by 6.7- and 8.9-fold, respectively. These increases are 
      consistent with CYP3A4 inhibition by posaconazole. Adverse events were reported 
      by five subjects (42%) receiving posaconazole and sirolimus and by three (25%) 
      and eight (67%) subjects receiving posaconazole only on days 30 to 35 
      (presirolimus) and days 37 to 45 (postsirolimus), respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      Because posaconazole has a clinically relevant effect on sirolimus exposure, the 
      agents should probably not be coadministered. Although this was a descriptive 
      study, one potential limitation was the small sample size. The conclusion could 
      have been made stronger if the number of people enrolled in the study had been 
      greater.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and safety of single oral doses of sirolimus (rapamycin) in 
      healthy male volunteers.
PG  - 537-44
AB  - A phase I study was conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics, safety, and 
      tolerability of sirolimus, a new immunosuppressive drug, in 45 healthy men 
      between 19 and 36 years of age. Nine subjects in each group were randomly 
      assigned to receive single oral doses of either sirolimus (n = 6) or placebo (n = 
      3) in group I (0.3 mg/m2), group II (1 mg/m2), group III (3 mg/m2), group IV (5 
      mg/m2) and group V (8 mg/m2). No serious adverse events occurred during the 
      study. Twenty-eight of the 45 volunteers (62%) reported an adverse event; 19 of 
      30 (63%) were in the sirolimus group and 9 of 15 (60%) were in the placebo group 
      (ns). Asthenia was the most common adverse event, occurring in 7 of 30 (23%) in 
      the sirolimus group compared with 6 of 15 (40%) in the placebo group (ns). 
      Absorption occurred within 1 hour in all volunteers. Whole blood peak 
      concentration and area under the concentration-time curve increased 
      proportionally with dose. Mean (+/- SD) whole blood terminal disposition 
      half-life (t1/2), apparent oral dose clearance (Cl/F), and volume of distribution 
      (Vss/F) were 82 +/- 12 hours, 278 +/- 117 mL/h x kg and 23 +/- 10 L/kg, 
      respectively. Distribution of sirolimus into formed blood elements was extensive, 
      with a mean whole blood-to-plasma ratio of 36. Single oral doses of sirolimus 
      (0.3 to 8 mg/m2) solution were well tolerated in healthy male volunteers.

TI  - Increased mycophenolic acid exposure in stable kidney transplant recipients on 
      tacrolimus as compared with those on sirolimus: implications for 
      pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 411-5
LID - 10.1038/clpt.2009.129 [doi]
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid (MPA) was studied in 23 kidney 
      transplant recipients with stable, long-term graft function who were receiving 
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in combination with either tacrolimus or sirolimus 
      therapy. After 500 mg MMF, the mean MPA area under the curve (AUC) was 
      significantly lower in sirolimus-treated patients than in those treated with 
      tacrolimus (35.4 +/- 32.3 vs. 77.1 +/- 67.5 mg/l). MPA peak plasma concentration 
      (C(max)) and MPA trough plasma concentration (C(min)) were significantly higher 
      in patients who received tacrolimus than in those who received sirolimus. There 
      were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to MPA time 
      to maximum concentration (T(max)), MPA-glucuronide (MPAG) AUC, MPAG C(max), MPAG 
      C(min), MPAG T(max), MPA-acyl-glucuronide (AcMPAG) AUC, AcMPAG C(max), AcMPAG 
      C(min), and AcMPAG T(max). In conclusion, MPA exposure is greater in 
      tacrolimus-treated patients than in those treated with sirolimus during 
      maintenance immunosuppression after kidney transplant. It is suggested that the 
      influence of tacrolimus on the pharmacokinetics of MPA reflects an interaction of 
      the two agents at the level of their intestinal absorption.

TI  - Co-administration of sirolimus alters tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in a 
      dose-dependent manner in adult renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 181-5
AB  - A combination of tacrolimus (TAC) and sirolimus (SIR) has recently proved to be a 
      very effective immunosuppressive regimen in organ transplantation. In pediatric 
      transplant recipients, co-administration of these two drugs has been shown to 
      result in a significant decrease of exposure to TAC, whereas conflicting data 
      have been obtained regarding this pharmacokinetic interaction in adults. The aim 
      of this study was to investigate the effect of SIR on TAC pharmacokinetics in 
      adult transplant recipients. Sixteen adult patients (mean age 38+/-8 years), who 
      had been on standard TAC plus low-dose SIR immunosuppressive treatment for 6 
      months after renal transplantation, were enrolled for a TAC pharmacokinetic study 
      before and 15 days after discontinuing SIR. Eight patients had received SIR 0.5 
      mg day(-1) and eight patients 2 mg day(-1). TAC doses remained the same in all 
      patients after SIR withdrawal. After discontinuing SIR, statistically 
      significant, dose-dependent increases were observed in area under the curve 
      (AUC), peak (C(max)) and trough (C(min)) TAC concentrations (+15-20% and +27-32%, 
      after discontinuing the 0.5 and the 2 mg day(-1) doses, respectively). 
      Proportional decreases were consistently observed in apparent oral clearance 
      (-13% and -23%). Very good correlations were found between TAC AUC and C(min), 
      both before and after SIR withdrawal (R(2)=0.94, P<0.0001 and R(2)=0.97, 
      P<0.0001, respectively). Our findings clearly demonstrate that the SIR-induced 
      reduction in TAC exposure also takes place in adults and is, therefore, a 
      general, age-independent phenomenon. Hence, TAC levels need to be carefully 
      monitored in transplant recipients of any age, in order to avoid possible TAC 
      overexposure upon SIR discontinuation.

TI  - Influence of tumour burden on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics in HER2 positive 
      non-metastatic breast cancer.
PG  - 941-8
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12875 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Trastuzumab, an antibody binding to epidermal growth factor receptor-2 
      (HER2), has been approved to treat HER2-positive breast cancer in different 
      settings. This study aimed at evaluating the influence of tumour size on 
      trastuzumab pharmacokinetics (PK) in non-metastatic breast cancer patients 
      treated with short term pre-operative trastuzumab. METHODS: Trastuzumab PK data 
      were obtained from a multicentre, randomized and comparative study. This antibody 
      was administered pre-operatively to patients with localized HER2-positive breast 
      cancer as a single 4 mg kg(-1) loading dose followed by 5 weekly 2 mg kg(-1) 
      doses. Trastuzumab concentrations were measured repeatedly using an ELISA 
      technique. Tumour size was evaluated at baseline using breast echography. 
      Trastuzumab pharmacokinetics were studied using a population approach and a two 
      compartment model. The influence of tumour burden on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics 
      was quantified as a covariate. RESULTS: A total of 784 trastuzumab concentrations 
      were available from the 79 eligible patients. Estimated parameters 
      (interindiviual standard deviation) were central volume of distribution =2.1 l 
      (23%), peripheral volume of distribution =1.3 l (38%), intercompartment clearance 
      =0.36 l day(-1) , with an elimination half-life of 11.8 days. Typical clearance 
      was 0.22 l day(-1) (19%) and its value was increased with tumour size. In 
      patients with the highest tumour size, trastuzumab clearance was 50% [18%-92%] 
      higher than in patients with the lowest tumour size. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      non-metastatic breast cancer patients, trastuzumab clearance increases with 
      tumour size. The elimination half-life of trastuzumab was shorter in the present 
      population of patients than in metastatic breast cancer patients previously 
      studied.

      anti-restenosis activity. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and 
      pharmacokinetics of escalating single intravenous (IV) doses of ABT-578 in a 
      phase 1, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study. METHODS: Sixty adult 
      healthy males were divided into five IV-dose groups of 100, 300, 500, 700 and 
      900mug. Doses were administered as IV bolus over 3 minutes, with eight subjects 
      and four subjects receiving ABT-578 and placebo, respectively, in each dose 
      group. Higher doses were administered after evaluating safety from the preceding 
      lower doses. Blood concentrations of ABT-578 were sampled for 168 hours and 
      measured using LC-MS/MS with a limit of quantification of 0.20 ng/mL. RESULTS: 
      The pharmacokinetics of ABT-578 were essentially linear across the 100-900microg 
      dose range as illustrated by the dose-proportional increases in concentration at 
      5 minutes (C(5)) after the end of infusion and area under the concentration-time 
      curve (AUC). The mean half-life ranged between 26.0 and 40.2h over the studied 
      doses and was not significantly different over the 300-900mug dose range. The 
      mean clearance values ranged from 2.90 to 3.55 L/h. Single IV bolus doses up to 
      900mug of ABT-578 were well tolerated and no clinically significant changes in 
      physical examination results, vital signs or laboratory test results were 
      observed. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that the pharmacokinetics of IV ABT-578 
      are dose-proportional over the 100-900mug dose range. Single IV bolus doses up to 
      900mug were well tolerated in healthy male subjects.

AB  - This open-label, nonrandomized study was conducted to evaluate the steady-state 
      pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in 24 stable Chinese renal transplant patients 
      receiving daily oral maintenance doses of sirolimus (1-4 mg). Repeated trough and 
      serial whole blood sirolimus concentrations over a 24-hour dosing interval were 
      collected and assayed using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem 
      mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS). Non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was employed to 
      calculate sirolimus pharmacokinetic parameters. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 
      genotyping was performed. Cyclosporine (CsA) levels were determined for patients 
      who took concomitant CsA. Mean (±SD) sirolimus maximum concentration (Cmax ), 
      area under the concentration-time curve within a dosing interval of τ (AUCτ ), 
      oral clearance (CL/F), and trough concentration (Ctrough ) at steady state were: 
      14.1 ± 13.4 ng/mL, 199 ± 210 ng · h/mL, 10.1 ± 4.4 L/h, and 5.9 ± 6.3 ng/mL, 
      respectively. Median tmax (range) was 2.49 hours (1-12 hours). A strong 
      correlation was observed between Ctrough and AUCτ . Pharmacokinetics of sirolimus 
      in patients with and without concomitant CsA were comparable. Allele frequency of 
      CYP3A5*3 was 70.9% and a trend of higher oral clearance was observed in CYP3A5 
      expressers compared with non-expressers although the number of subjects in each 
      genotype was small.

TI  - Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single intravenous dose-escalation 
      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the novel 
      coronary smooth muscle cell proliferation inhibitor Biolimus A9 in healthy 
      individuals.
PG  - 29-39
LID - 10.1177/0091270010361255 [doi]
AB  - Biolimus A9 (BA9) is a novel proliferation inhibitor of coronary smooth muscle 
      cells that has been specifically designed for coating drug-eluting stents. The 
      goals of this study were to identify the highest safe intravenous dose of BA9, to 
      evaluate the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics of BA9 after intravenous 
      administration in humans, and to characterize early clinical symptoms of BA9 
      toxicity in healthy subjects. This phase 1 trial in healthy subjects was designed 
      as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, ascending single-dose study. 
      After screening and randomization, 28 volunteers received either placebo (n = 7) 
      or BA9 (n = 21) in a double-blinded fashion. Doses from 0.0075 mg/kg were 
      escalated to 0.25 mg/kg in 4 cohorts. BA9 concentrations were measured using 
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. BA9 doses up to 0.075 mg/kg were 
      well tolerated. Only the highest BA9 dose of 0.25 mg/kg produced reversible 
      drug-related adverse events. The most frequent adverse events were headache, 
      nausea, and mouth ulcers, most likely due to immunosuppression. Exposure to BA9 
      did not result in electrocardiographic or clinical laboratory changes. BA9 had a 
      terminal half-life of 90.0 ± 40.0 hours (all n = 21, mean ± standard deviation), 
      an apparent clearance from blood of 0.96 ± 1.07 L/kg/h, and a volume of 
      distribution of 96.5 ± 72.6 L/kg.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of an everolimus-cyclosporine immunosuppressive regimen over the 
      first 6 months after kidney transplantation.
PG  - 606-13
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of everolimus were characterized over the first 6 months 
      post transplant in 731 patients receiving either 0.75 or 1.5 mg bid everolimus in 
      addition to cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Pharmacokinetic data consisted of 
      4014 everolimus trough concentrations (Cmin) obtained in all patients and 659 
      area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) -profiles obtained at months 2, 3, 
      and 6 in a subset of 261 patients. Cmins averaged 4.3 +/- 2.4 and 7.2 +/- 4.2 
      ng/mL at 0.75 and 1.5 mg bid, indicating a 20% under-proportionality at the upper 
      dose level. Cmins were 19-34% lower in the first month compared with months 2 
      through 6-values. AUC was dose-proportional and stable over time, averaging 77 
      +/- 32 and 136 +/- 57 ng.h.mL-1 at the two dose levels. Within- and 
      between-patient variability in AUC were 27% and 31%, respectively. There was no 
      influence of sex, age (16-66 years), or weight (42-132 kg) on AUC. Everolimus 
      exposure was significantly lower by an average 20% in blacks. Everolimus exposure 
      was relatively stable over the first 6 months post transplant, with no major 
      departure from dose-proportionality over the therapeutic dose range. 
      Weight-adjusted dosing (mg/kg) does not appear warranted. Black patients may have 
      lower bioavailability and/or higher clearance of everolimus compared with white 
      patients.

AB  - This study examined the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in pediatric allogeneic 
      blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) recipients in the presence and absence of 
      concomitant fluconazole. Forty pediatric BMT recipients received a daily oral 
      dose of sirolimus and a continuous i.v. infusion of tacrolimus for 
      graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. Fluconazole was administered i.v. to 19 
      patients and orally to 6 patients. Full pharmacokinetic profiles of sirolimus 
      within a single dosing interval were collected. Whole-blood sirolimus 
      concentrations were measured by HPLC/mass spectrometry. Noncompartmental analysis 
      was performed using WinNonlin. Nonlinear mixed-effects pharmacokinetic models 
      were developed using NONMEM following standard procedures. The mean ± SD 
      sirolimus trough level before the dose (C0) was 8.0 ± 4.6 ng/mL (range, 1.8-21.6 
      ng/mL). The peak concentration was 19.9 ± 11.8 ng/mL (range, 3.9-46.1 ng/mL), and 
      the trough level 24 hours later (C24) was 9.1 ± 5.3 ng/mL (range, 1.0-19.1 
      ng/mL). The terminal disposition half-life (T1/2) was 24.5 ± 11.2 hours (range, 
      5.8-53.2 hours), and the area under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUC0-24) 
      was 401.1 ± 316.3 ng·h/mL (range, 20.7-1332.3 ng·h/mL). In patients at steady 
      state, C0 and C24 were closely correlated (R(2) = 0.77) with a slope of 0.99, 
      indicating the achievement of steady state. C24 was 1.7-fold greater (P = .036) 
      and AUC0-24 was 2-fold greater (P = .012) in Caucasian patients (n = 22) compared 
      with Hispanic patients (n = 9). The average apparent oral clearance was 3-fold 
      greater (P = .001) and the apparent oral volume of distribution was 2-fold 
      greater (P = .018) in patients age ≤12 years compared with those age >12 years. 
      C24 was significantly lower in patients (n = 10) who developed grade III-IV aGVHD 
      (n = 10) than in those with grade 0-II aGVHD (n = 22) (6.1 ± 2.9 ng/mL versus 9.4 
      ± 5.5 ng/mL; P = .044). Dose-normalized sirolimus trough concentrations were 
      significantly higher in patients receiving concomitant fluconazole therapy 
      compared with those not receiving fluconazole (C0: 3.9 ± 2.5 versus 2.4 ± 1.5 
      ng/mL/mg, P = .030; C24: 4.8 ± 3.3 versus 2.5 ± 1.7 ng/mL/mg, P = .018). This 
      pharmacokinetic study of sirolimus in pediatric patients documents a large 
      interindividual variability in the exposure of sirolimus. Steady-state trough 
      blood concentrations were correlated with drug exposure. Trough concentrations 
      were higher with a concomitant use of fluconazole and were higher in Caucasian 
      patients than in Hispanic patients. Oral clearance was greater in children age 
      ≤12 years than in older children and adolescents. With therapeutic drug 
      monitoring, the majority (79%) of sirolimus trough levels could be maintained 
      within the target range (3-12 ng/mL). This study provides a rationale and support 
      for dose adjustments of sirolimus based on steady-state blood concentrations 
      aimed at achieving a target concentration to minimize toxicity and maximize 
      therapeutic benefits in pediatric BMT recipients.

TI  - Dose Escalation Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetic Parameters of a 
      Nano-amorphous Oral Sirolimus Formulation in Healthy Volunteers.
PG  - 777-785
LID - 10.1007/s13318-019-00562-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sirolimus (Rapamune(®)) exhibits low bioavailability, 
      high variability and moderate food effect following oral administration. This 
      makes therapeutic blood monitoring of sirolimus concentrations necessary for 
      kidney transplant patients. Furthermore, reaching therapeutic blood sirolimus 
      concentrations in renal cancer patients was found to be challenging when the 
      marketed drug was administered alone. A novel, nano-amorphous formulation of the 
      compound was developed and its pharmacokinetic properties were investigated in a 
      dose escalation study in a first-in-human clinical trial. The effect of food at 
      the highest dose on the pharmacokinetic parameters was also assessed. METHODS: 
      Each group received one of the escalating doses (0.5-2-10-40 mg) of sirolimus as 
      the novel formulation in the fasted state. Following a 2- to 3-week washout 
      period, the 40-mg group then also received another 40 mg dose in the fed state. 
      Sirolimus whole blood concentrations were determined for up to 48 h. To avoid 
      degradation of sirolimus in the acidic environment in the stomach, 40 mg 
      famotidine was administered 3 h pre-dose in all regimens. The main 
      pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and data were compared with 
      pharmacokinetic data reported for dose escalation studies for Rapamune(®). 
      RESULTS: Thirty-two healthy volunteers were divided into 4 cohorts of 8 
      volunteers. Dose increments resulted in approximately dose-proportional increases 
      of maximal plasma concentrations (C(max)) and area under the concentration-time 
      curve (AUC)(0-48 h) up to 10 mg, while less than dose-proportional increases were 
      observed when the dose was increased from 10 to 40 mg. Mean AUC(inf) at the 40 mg 
      dose in the fasted state was 4,300 ± 1,083 ng·h/ml, which is 28% higher than the 
      AUC reported following the administration of 90 (2 × 45) mg Rapamune(®) and 11% 
      higher than the exposure reported for 25 mg intravenous pro-drug temsirolimus 
      (3,810 ng·h/ml). At the 40 mg dose, food reduced C(max) by 35.5%, but it had no 
      statistically significant effect on AUC. Inter-individual variability of the 
      pharmacokinetic parameters mostly fell in the 20-30% (CV) range showing that 
      sirolimus administered as the nano-amorphous formulation is a low-to-moderate 
      variability drug. CONCLUSION: Based on the pharmacokinetic profiles observed, the 
      nano-amorphous formulation could be a better alternative to Rapamune(®) for the 
      treatment of mammalian target of rapamycin-responsive malignancies. 
      Therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations and exposures can be achieved by a 
      single 40 mg oral dose. Furthermore, the low variability observed might make 
      therapeutic blood monitoring unnecessary for transplant patients taking sirolimus 
      as an immunosuppressant.

TI  - The evaluation of potential pharmacokinetic interaction between sirolimus and 
      tacrolimus in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 835-42
LID - 10.1007/s00228-012-1407-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sirolimus and tacrolimus are immunosuppressive compounds that have been 
      used concomitantly in renal transplant patients. Both drugs are dosed orally and 
      have common intestinal and hepatic metabolism and intestinal transport 
      mechanisms. As such, there is a potential for pharmacokinetic drug interaction. 
      METHODS: A single-dose, open-label, four-period, four-treatment, randomized 
      crossover study was conducted in 27 healthy fasting volunteers. Each subject 
      received a 15-mg oral dose of sirolimus alone, a 10-mg oral dose of tacrolimus 
      alone, sirolimus and tacrolimus administered simultaneously, and tacrolimus 
      administered 4 h before sirolimus. Whole blood and plasma samples for sirolimus 
      and tacrolimus testing were analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
      spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed using noncompartmental 
      methods and were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: The 
      geometric mean ratio and 90 % confidence interval (CI) area under the 
      concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) for sirolimus 
      administered simultaneously with tacrolimus versus sirolimus alone were 97 and 
      89-106, respectively, and, when administered in a staggered approach versus 
      sirolimus alone, 107 and 98-117, respectively. The geometric mean ratio (%) and 
      90 % CI AUCinf for tacrolimus administered simultaneously with sirolimus versus 
      tacrolimus alone were 92 and 82-102, respectively, and, when administered in a 
      staggered approach versus tacrolimus alone, 94 and 84-105, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate a lack of any clinically 
      important drug interaction between sirolimus and tacrolimus in healthy subjects 
      after single-dose administration. However, due to the complexity of 
      anti-rejection immunosuppressive therapy dosing, we suggest that sirolimus and 
      tacrolimus concentration monitoring be performed when changes in dosing are made 
      for either drug regimen.

TI  - Longitudinal Pharmacokinetics of Everolimus When Combined With Low-level of 
      Tacrolimus in Elderly Renal Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 2133-2138
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000001549 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the proportion of elderly patients among renal transplant 
      recipients has increased, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of immunosuppressants 
      rarely include older patients. METHODS: We studied 12-hour everolimus (EVL) PK in 
      16 elderly renal transplant recipients (all whites; 10 men; mean age, 64 ± 2 
      years (61-71 years), in 4 separate timepoints (at 7, 30, 60, and 150 days) after 
      EVL introduction, corresponding to a mean postrenal transplantation day: PK1 (43 
      ± 4 days), PK2 (65 ± 7 days), PK3 (106 ± 17 days), and PK4 (206 ± 40 days). 
      Patients received EVL (target trough level (Ctrough, 3-8 ng/mL), prednisone, and 
      tacrolimus (TCL) (target Ctrough, 2-5 ng/mL). RESULTS: Mean TCL-Ctrough was 7.2 ± 
      3.8, 4.9 ± 2.2, 4.9 ± 2.2, and 4.5 ± 1.2 ng/mL at PK1, PK2, PK3, and PK4, 
      respectively. There were no differences among timepoints for mean EVL daily dose 
      (data shown as PK3) (3.5 ± 1.3 mg/d), Ctrough (4.7 ± 2.5 ng/mL), AUC0-12h (106 ± 
      51 ng/h per mL), Caverage (8.8 ± 4.2 ng/mL), Cmax (19.2 ± 9.7 ng/mL), apparent 
      Half-life (11.7 ± 4.2 hours), estimated total body clearance (0.39 ± 0.27 L/h), 
      or fluctuation (166 ± 65%). Also, none of those PK parameters differed 
      statistically when adjusted for body weight. EVL-Ctrough showed a very high 
      correlation (r = 0.849) with AUC0-12h. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that 
      elderly renal transplant recipients starting EVL 1 month after transplantation 
      along with a steady-state TCL level, present stable EVL-PK parameters without 
      significant changes in dose or exposure during the first 6 months after renal 
      transplantation.

TI  - Comparison of temsirolimus pharmacokinetics in patients with renal cell carcinoma 
      not receiving dialysis and those receiving hemodialysis: a case series.
PG  - 1812-9
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.08.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous temsirolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of 
      rapamycin (mTOR), is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma 
      (RCC). Sirolimus, the principal metabolite of temsirolimus in humans, also 
      exhibits mTOR inhibitory activity. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to 
      compare the pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus and its metabolite, sirolimus, among 
      patients with RCC not receiving dialysis and those receiving hemodialysis. 
      METHODS: This was a single-center, unblinded, single-dose study. Patients with 
      histologically confirmed metastatic RCC were eligible. A single 25-mg dose of 
      temsirolimus was administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion during the 
      first round of chemotherapy. Blood samples were drawn at 0 (predose), 0.5 (end of 
      infusion), 1.5, 2.5, 5.5, 24, 72, and 144 hours after infusion. In patients 
      receiving hemodialysis, an additional blood sample was drawn 1 hour after each 
      treatment to compare pre- and postconcentration. Temsirolimus concentrations were 
      assayed in blood using HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters (C(max), T(max), t((1/2)), AUC(0-infinity), total body clearance, 
      volume of distribution at steady state, AUC ratio [the ratio of sirolimus to 
      temsirolimus AUCs], and AUC sum [the algebraic sum of temsirolimus and sirolimus 
      AUCs]) were calculated and analyzed statistically. RESULTS: In total, 13 
      consecutive patients (11 men and 2 women; 11 not receiving dialysis and 2 
      receiving hemodialysis) were included. No patient refused to participate in the 
      study. Of those not receiving dialysis, the median age was 54 years (range, 36-77 
      years), and of those receiving hemodialysis, the median age was 60.5 years (60-61 
      years). There were no significant between-group differences in the 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of temsirolimus and sirolimus. Moreover, in patients 
      receiving hemodialysis, blood drug concentrations assessed immediately before 
      hemodialysis were similar to those assayed 1 hour after the treatment. 
      CONCLUSION: This study found that after single-dose administration of 25 mg of 
      temsirolimus as a 30-minute intravenous infusion, neither temsirolimus nor 
      sirolimus concentrations were significantly affected in these patients with RCC 
      receiving hemodi-alysis compared with those not receiving dialysis.

TI  - Differential pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus and cyclosporine on 
      everolimus.
PG  - 3456-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We characterized the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus and everolimus in 
      a combined immunosuppressive regimen. METHODS: This was an open-label exploratory 
      trial in eight maintenance renal transplant patients with calcineurin inhibitor 
      intolerance initially receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus. At 
      enrollment, MMF was discontinued and replaced with everolimus 1.5 mg twice a day 
      in study period 1 (days 1 to 10). In period 2 (day 11 to month 3), tacrolimus 
      dose was reduced by half. RESULTS: At study entry tacrolimus trough level (C0) 
      was 7.9 +/- 3.9 ng/mL and area under the curve over a dosing interval (AUC) was 
      132 +/- 56 ng x h/mL. The addition of everolimus in period 1 did not change 
      tacrolimus exposure: C0 8.4 +/- 4.0 ng/mL, AUC 134 +/- 70 ng x h/mL. Everolimus 
      pharmacokinetics in the presence of tacrolimus in period 1 were: C0 3.3 +/- 1.2 
      ng/mL, Cmax 10.4 +/- 5.1 ng/mL, AUC 58 +/- 20 ng x h/mL. When compared to 
      pharmacokinetic data from a previous study in 47 renal transplant patients 
      receiving everolimus at the same fixed dose (1.5 mg twice a day) with 
      cyclosporine, everolimus exposure was 2.5-fold higher with cyclosporine relative 
      to the data in this study with tacrolimus. After tacrolimus dose reduction in 
      period 2, there was no clinically relevant change in everolimus exposure: C0 3.0 
      +/- 1.1 ng/mL, Cmax 8.2 +/- 1.3 ng/mL, AUC 49 +/- 10 ng x h/mL. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Tacrolimus appears to have a minimal effect on everolimus blood levels compared 
      with the influence of cyclosporine. The dose of everolimus when combined with 
      tacrolimus needs to be higher than when combined with cyclosporine in order to 
      reach a given everolimus blood level.

TI  - Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of capecitabine and the oral mTOR inhibitor 
      everolimus in patients with advanced solid malignancies.
PG  - 1557-65
LID - 10.1007/s10637-011-9723-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Everolimus is an oral mTOR-inhibitor. Preclinical data show 
      synergistic effects of mTOR inhibition in combination with 5-fluorouracil-based 
      anticancer therapy. The combination of everolimus with capecitabine seems 
      therefore an attractive new, orally available, treatment regimen. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of everolimus in 
      combination with capecitabine were investigated in patients with advanced solid 
      malignancies. Patients were treated with fixed dose everolimus 10 mg/day 
      continuously, plus capecitabine bid for 14 days in three-weekly cycles. Dose 
      escalation of capecitabine proceeded according to the standard 3 × 3 phase I 
      design in four predefined dose levels (500-1,000 mg/m(2) bid). RESULTS: In total, 
      18 patients were enrolled. Median (range) treatment duration with everolimus was 
      70 days (21-414). Capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) bid combined with 10 mg/day 
      everolimus was declared the maximum tolerated dose, at which level one patient 
      developed dose-limiting toxicity (stomatitis grade 3). Drug-related adverse 
      events were mostly grade ≤ 2 and included mainly fatigue (56%), stomatitis (50%), 
      and hand-foot syndrome (33%). Partial response was documented in three patients, 
      and four had stable disease. There was no pharmacokinetic interaction between 
      everolimus and capecitabine. CONCLUSION: Everolimus 10 mg/day continuously 
      combined with capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) bid for 14 days every 3 weeks is a 
      patient-convenient, safe and tolerable oral treatment regimen. This is the first 
      study to demonstrate feasibility of this combination at doses with proven single 
      agent efficacy in a number of tumors. Prolonged clinical benefit was observed in 
      an encouraging 39% of patients with advanced solid malignancies.

AB  - Concurrent delivery of multiple poorly water-soluble anticancer drugs has been a 
      great challenge due to the toxicities exerted by different surfactants or organic 
      solvents used in solubilizing individual drugs. We previously found that 
      poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(D, L-lactic acid) (PEG-b-PLA) micelles can serve 
      as a safe delivery platform for simultaneous delivery of paclitaxel (PTX), 
      17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), and rapamycin (RAP) to mice. The 
      high tolerance of this polymeric micelle formulation by mice allowed us to 
      investigate the pharmacokinetics of the 3 co-delivered drugs. In this study, it 
      was shown that 3-in-1 PEG-b-PLA micelle delivering high doses of PTX, 17-AAG, and 
      RAP (60, 60, and 30 mg/kg, respectively) significantly increased the values of 
      the area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) of PTX and RAP in mice 
      compared to the drugs delivered individually, while the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of 17-AAG were similar in both 3-in-1 and single drug-loaded PEG-b-PLA 
      micelle formulations. Moreover, pharmacokinetic study using 2-in-1 micelles 
      indicated that the augmented AUC value of RAP was due to the co-delivery of 
      17-AAG, while the increase in AUC of PTX was more likely caused by the 
      co-delivery of RAP. In contrast, when 3-in-1 and single drug-loaded PEG-b-PLA 
      micelles were administrated at modest dose (PTX, 17-AAG, and RAP at 10, 10, and 5 
      mg/kg, respectively), pharmacokinetic differences of individual drugs between 
      3-in-1 and single drug formulations were eliminated. These results suggest that 
      3-in-1 PEG-b-PLA micelles can concurrently deliver PTX, 17-AAG, and RAP without 
      changing the pharmacokinetics of each drug at modest doses, but altered 
      pharmacokinetic profiles emerge when drugs are delivered at higher doses.

TI  - Phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of the oral mammalian target of 
      rapamycin inhibitor everolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 1588-95
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2007.14.0988 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the optimal regimen and dosage of the oral mammalian target 
      of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus (RAD001). METHODS: We performed a 
      dose-escalation study in advanced cancer patients administering oral everolimus 5 
      to 30 mg/wk, with pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies. PD data 
      prompted investigation of 50 and 70 mg weekly and daily dosing at 5 and 10 mg. 
      RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were treated. Dose-limiting toxicity was seen in one 
      patient each at 50 mg/wk (stomatitis and fatigue) and 10 mg/d (hyperglycemia); 
      hence, the maximum-tolerated dose was not reached. S6 kinase 1 activity in 
      peripheral-blood mononuclear cells was inhibited for at least 7 days at doses 
      >or= 20 mg/wk. Area under the curve increased proportional to dose, but maximum 
      serum concentration increased less than proportionally at doses >or= 20 mg/wk. 
      Terminal half-life was 30 hours (range, 26 to 38 hours). Partial responses were 
      observed in four patients, and 12 patients remained progression free for >or= 6 
      months, including five of 10 patients with renal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSION: 
      Everolimus was satisfactorily tolerated at dosages up to 70 mg/wk and 10 mg/d 
      with predictable PK. Antitumor activity and PD in tumors require further clinical 
      investigation. Doses of 20 mg/wk and 5 mg/d are recommended as appropriate 
      starting doses for these studies.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of rapamycin: single-dose studies in the rabbit.
PG  - 475-8
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of rapamycin was investigated in five New Zealand white 
      rabbits following intravenous administration of 0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg rapamycin in a 
      randomized crossover fashion. Whole blood concentrations of rapamycin were 
      analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Model-dependent and 
      -independent parameters were calculated. The volume of distribution at steady 
      state and total body clearance increased significantly as the dose increased. 
      Rapamycin pharmacokinetics appear to be nonlinear. The whole blood volume of 
      distribution, especially at the higher dose, indicated distribution out of the 
      blood component. The drug is not cleared rapidly, with a terminal half-life of > 
      13 hours as calculated by model-independent parameters. The 24-h whole blood 
      trough concentrations of the drug are well within the analytical range of the 
      HPLC procedure. This should permit trough level monitoring for therapeutic range 
      studies involving the drug.

TI  - Sirolimus PK trial: a pharmacokinetic study of the sirolimus-eluting Bx velocity 
      stent in patients with de novo coronary lesions.
PG  - 32-7
AB  - This study was conducted to assess the systemic drug release and distribution of 
      sirolimus-eluting stents. Early results with sirolimus-eluting stents have 
      demonstrated a favorable outcome for reducing restenosis post coronary 
      intervention. However, the clinical systemic pharmacokinetics of sirolimus 
      released from these stents has not been investigated. Sirolimus-eluting stents 
      (150-178 mcg/18 mm stent) were implanted in 19 patients with coronary artery 
      disease using standard techniques. Blood samples were obtained at multiple times 
      to determine the kinetics of sirolimus release and elimination. Non-compartmental 
      analysis showed that the maximum blood concentration of sirolimus occurred 
      between 3 and 4 hr after implantation, with a peak concentration of 0.57 +/- 0.12 
      ng/mL (mean +/- SD) and 1.05 +/- 0.39 ng/mL in patients receiving one or two 
      stents, respectively. Terminal-phase elimination half-life was independent of the 
      number of stents and averaged at 213 hr, a value longer than that seen in 
      patients following oral dosing. The apparent clearance was 1.46 +/- 0.45 L/hr 
      with an apparent volume of distribution in the terminal phase of 407 +/- 111 L 
      (data for both stent doses pooled). Minimal measurable blood levels were 
      detectable at 7 days. Peak whole blood level following sirolimus stent 
      implantation in humans is proportional to the number of stents implanted. The 
      prolonged terminal half-life may reflect kinetics of blood clearance combined 
      with continued drug elution and secondary local tissue release.

TI  - Influence of everolimus on cyclosporine Neoral pharmacokinetics in Chinese de 
      novo cardiac transplant recipients.
PG  - 2032-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the influence of everolimus on 
      cyclosporine Neoral (CsA) pharmacokinetics over the first 6 months after heart 
      transplantation in Chinese recipients. METHODS: Six de novo cardiac recipients 
      receiving a CsA-everolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen after rabbit 
      antithymoglobulin sequential immuno-induction were compared with six age-matched 
      recipients receiving a CsA-azathioprine-based regimen. We compared CsA 12-hour 
      area-under-curve (AUC) of the first dose (PK-1) and steady state dose (PK-S) at 1 
      month after transplantation. The CsA trough concentrations (Cmin) were compared 
      over the first 6 months after transplantation. RESULTS: There was no significant 
      difference between the two groups in age, gender, and body weight. With respect 
      to dose-normalized CsA AUC(0-infinity) of PK-1 and dose-normalized CsA AUC(0-12) 
      of PK-S, the difference between the everolimus- and the azathioprine-based 
      regimens was not significant. The dose-normalized CsA trough concentrations 
      (Cmin/dose) were significantly lower in the everolimus-based group than in the 
      azathioprine-based group during the first 5 months after heart transplantation, 
      but the difference was not significant at posttransplantation month 6. 
      CONCLUSIONS: When CsA pharmacokinetic profiles were considered, the CsA dose 
      requirement was not lower in Chinese patients receiving everolimus than that in 
      patients receiving azathioprine. The results differed from reports from Western 
      countries.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Assessment of Drug-Drug Interactions of Isavuconazole With the 
      Immunosuppressants Cyclosporine, Mycophenolic Acid, Prednisolone, Sirolimus, and 
      Tacrolimus in Healthy Adults.
PG  - 76-85
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.284 [doi]
AB  - This report summarizes phase 1 studies that evaluated pharmacokinetic 
      interactions between the novel triazole antifungal agent isavuconazole and the 
      immunosuppressants cyclosporine, mycophenolic acid, prednisolone, sirolimus, and 
      tacrolimus in healthy adults. Healthy subjects received single oral doses of 
      cyclosporine (300 mg; n = 24), mycophenolate mofetil (1000 mg; n = 24), 
      prednisone (20 mg; n = 21), sirolimus (2 mg; n = 22), and tacrolimus (5 mg; n = 
      24) in the presence and absence of clinical doses of oral isavuconazole (200 mg 3 
      times daily for 2 days; 200 mg once daily thereafter). Coadministration with 
      isavuconazole increased the area under the concentration-time curves (AUC(0-∞) ) 
      of tacrolimus, sirolimus, and cyclosporine by 125%, 84%, and 29%, respectively, 
      and the AUCs of mycophenolic acid and prednisolone by 35% and 8%, respectively. 
      Maximum concentrations (C(max) ) of tacrolimus, sirolimus, and cyclosporine were 
      42%, 65%, and 6% higher, respectively; C(max) of mycophenolic acid and 
      prednisolone were 11% and 4% lower, respectively. Isavuconazole pharmacokinetics 
      were mostly unaffected by the immunosuppressants. Two subjects experienced 
      elevated creatinine levels in the cyclosporine study; most adverse events were 
      not considered to be of clinical concern. These results indicate that 
      isavuconazole is an inhibitor of cyclosporine, mycophenolic acid, sirolimus, and 
      tacrolimus metabolism.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interactions between sirolimus and microemulsion cyclosporine 
      when orally administered jointly and 4 hours apart in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1168-76
AB  - Sirolimus (RAPA) and cyclosporine (CsA) are immunosuppressive compounds that are 
      being used concomitantly in renal transplant patients. Both drugs are dosed 
      orally, have common intestinal and hepatic metabolism and intestinal transport 
      mechanisms, and thus offer potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions. A 
      single-dose, open-label, four-period, four-treatment, randomized crossover study 
      was completed in 15 male and 6 female volunteers. Each subject received a 10-mg 
      oral dose of RAPA alone (Rapamune Oral Solution), a 300-mg oral dose of CsA alone 
      (3 x 100-mg Neoral Soft Gelatin Capsules), RAPA and CsA jointly, and CsA followed 
      by RAPA delayed by 4 hours. Blood samples were collected for either 144 hours 
      (RAPA) or 48 hours (CsA) and analyzed by either liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
      spectrometry (RAPA) or radioimmunoassay (CsA). RAPA bioavailability was markedly 
      increased by CsA when given jointly, with Cmax,tmax, and AUC being increased 
      116%, 92%, and 230%, respectively. However, when RAPA was administered 4 hours 
      after CsA, increases in RAPA Cmax, tmax, and AUC were only 37%, 58%, and 80%, 
      respectively. CsA did not affect t1/2 or mean residence time (MRT) by either mode 
      of combined administration. RAPA did not significantly affect CsA bioavailability 
      after either joint or delayed combined administrations. It was concluded that CsA 
      markedly increases the bioavailability of RAPA, which may be attributed to a 
      large intestinal and hepatic first-pass effect, rather than altered elimination. 
      RAPA did not affect the bioavailability of CsA.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 
      when coadministered with everolimus.
PG  - 222-8
AB  - The authors assessed the mutual influence of the immunosuppressant everolimus 
      (Certican) and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors atorvastatin and pravastatin when 
      coadministered based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measures. In this 
      randomized, open-label, three-way crossover study, 24 healthy men received three 
      single-dose oral treatments: 2 mg everolimus, 20 mg atorvastatin (n = 12) or 20 
      mg pravastatin (n = 12), and the respective statin coadministered with 
      everolimus. Consecutive treatments were separated by a 14-day washout. The 
      pharmacokinetics of all three drugs and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were 
      measured. Everolimus Cmax was reduced by 9% and 10% with atorvastatin and 
      pravastatin coadministration; the corresponding decreases in everolimus AUC were 
      5% and 6%, respectively. Everolimus coadministration increased the Cmax of 
      atorvastatin by 11% but had no influence on atorvastatin AUC. Coadministration of 
      everolimus with pravastatin was associated with a 10% decrease in pravastatin 
      Cmax and a 5% decrease in the AUC. The elimination half-lives of the two statins 
      were unaffected by everolimus. Changes in total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in 
      plasma exhibited generally similar patterns as for the parent statin exposures. 
      Single-dose administrations of everolimus with either atorvastatin or pravastatin 
      did not influence the pharmacokinetics of everolimus, atorvastatin, pravastatin, 
      or total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in plasma to a clinically relevant extent.

TI  - Phase I studies of sirolimus alone or in combination with pharmacokinetic 
      modulators in advanced cancer patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: Sirolimus is the eponymous inhibitor of the mTOR; however, only its 
      analogs have been approved as cancer therapies. Nevertheless, sirolimus is 
      readily available, has been well studied in organ transplant patients, and shows 
      efficacy in several preclinical cancer models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three 
      simultaneously conducted phase I studies in advanced cancer patients used an 
      adaptive escalation design to find the dose of oral, weekly sirolimus alone or in 
      combination with either ketoconazole or grapefruit juice that achieves similar 
      blood concentrations as its intravenously administered and approved prodrug, 
      temsirolimus. In addition, the effect of sirolimus on inhibition of p70S6 kinase 
      phosphorylation in peripheral T cells was determined. RESULTS: Collectively, the 
      three studies enrolled 138 subjects. The most commonly observed toxicities were 
      hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and lymphopenia in 52%, 43%, and 41% of subjects, 
      respectively. The target sirolimus area under the concentration curve (AUC) of 
      3,810 ng-h/mL was achieved at sirolimus doses of 90, 16, and 25 mg in the 
      sirolimus alone, sirolimus plus ketoconazole, and sirolimus plus grapefruit juice 
      studies, respectively. Ketoconazole and grapefruit juice increased sirolimus AUC 
      approximately 500% and 350%, respectively. Inhibition of p70 S6 kinase 
      phosphorylation was observed at all doses of sirolimus and correlated with blood 
      concentrations. One partial response was observed in a patient with epithelioid 
      hemangioendothelioma. CONCLUSION: Sirolimus can be feasibly administered orally, 
      once weekly with a similar toxicity and pharmacokinetic profile compared with 
      other mTOR inhibitors and warrants further evaluation in studies of its 
      comparative effectiveness relative to recently approved sirolimus analogs.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of sirolimus and tacrolimus in pediatric transplant patients.
PG  - 767-73
AB  - To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Sirolimus (SRL) and Tacrolimus (TAC) in 
      pediatric transplant recipients. Fifty-one SRL and 55 TAC pharmacokinetic 
      profiles were obtained from 20 male and 14 female recipients of liver alone (LTx, 
      n = 23), small bowel alone, and with liver (SBTx, n = 11). The median age was 
      13.3 years (range 0.9-23.9). Whole blood concentrations of SRL and TAC were 
      determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and 
      microparticulate enzyme immunoassay (MEIA-Abbott Laboratories, IL), respectively. 
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were derived from noncompartmental model 
      analysis. The half-life was estimated using the data points during the terminal 
      disposition phase and area under the concentration (AUC) time curve was 
      calculated within a dosing interval using the trapezoidal method. The dose of SRL 
      or TAC did not correlate with the corresponding AUCs. Trough concentrations of 
      SRL and TAC correlated well with AUC (r = 0.8544 and 0.8603, respectively). 
      Half-life (h) did not differ significantly between different transplant groups 
      for SRL and TAC (SRL: LTx: 21.2 h, SBTx: 19.3 h; TAC: LTx: 14.1 h, SBTx: 12.7 h). 
      Serial PK analysis with the first measurement within 14 days after 
      transplantation revealed no difference in AUC/dose/BSA for SRL, with time. During 
      this period, SRL half-life increased significantly, from 11.2 +/- 1.0-20.1 +/- 
      3.1 h (n = 4; p = 0.02). After introduction of SRL, TAC half-life did not change 
      (11.6 +/- 3.9-14.0 +/- 10.4, n = 10, P = 0.52) in all the groups analyzed 
      together. TAC AUC/dose/BSA decreased significantly in LTx and SBTx patients (90.9 
      +/- 55.3 vs. 48.8 +/- 27.3). Trough concentration measurements provide good 
      estimates of SRL and TAC exposure in pediatric transplant recipients. The short 
      half-life of SRL in children may support twice-daily administration early after 
      liver and small intestinal transplantation. During conversion of subjects from 
      TAC to combined TAC and SRL, aggressive therapeutic drug monitoring must be used 
      to individualize therapy and avoid serous adverse events.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of orally administered low-dose rapamycin in healthy dogs.
PG  - 65-71
LID - 10.2460/ajvr.77.1.65 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the pharmacokinetics of orally administered rapamycin in 
      healthy dogs. ANIMALS: 5 healthy purpose-bred hounds. PROCEDURES: The study 
      consisted of 2 experiments. In experiment 1, each dog received rapamycin (0.1 
      mg/kg, PO) once; blood samples were obtained immediately before and at 0.5, 1, 2, 
      4, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after administration. In experiment 2, each dog 
      received rapamycin (0.1 mg/kg, PO) once daily for 5 days; blood samples were 
      obtained immediately before and at 3, 6, 24, 27, 30, 48, 51, 54, 72, 75, 78, 96, 
      96.5, 97, 98, 100, 102, 108, 120, 144, and 168 hours after the first dose. Blood 
      rapamycin concentration was determined by a validated liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were 
      determined by compartmental and noncompartmental analyses. RESULTS: Mean ± SD 
      blood rapamycin terminal half-life, area under the concentration-time curve from 
      0 to 48 hours after dosing, and maximum concentration were 38.7 ± 12.7 h, 140 ± 
      23.9 ng•h/mL, and 8.39 ± 1.73 ng/mL, respectively, for experiment 1, and 99.5 ± 
      89.5 h, 126 ± 27.1 ng•h/mL, and 5.49 ± 1.99 ng/mL, respectively, for experiment 
      2. Pharmacokinetic parameters for rapamycin after administration of 5 daily doses 
      differed significantly from those after administration of 1 dose. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated that oral administration of low-dose (0.1 
      mg/kg) rapamycin to healthy dogs achieved blood concentrations measured in 
      nanograms per milliliter. The optimal dose and administration frequency of 
      rapamcyin required to achieve therapeutic effects in tumor-bearing dogs, as well 
      as toxicity after chronic dosing, need to be determined.

TI  - Phase 1 and pharmacokinetic study of everolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin 
      inhibitor, in combination with docetaxel for recurrent/refractory nonsmall cell 
      lung cancer.
PG  - 3903-9
LID - 10.1002/cncr.25264 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Everolimus is a novel inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin 
      pathway, which is aberrantly activated in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The 
      authors conducted a phase 1 and pharmacokinetic study of everolimus and docetaxel 
      for recurrent NSCLC. METHODS: Patients with advanced stage NSCLC and progression 
      after prior platinum-based chemotherapy were eligible. Sequential cohorts were 
      treated with escalating doses of docetaxel (Day 1) and everolimus (orally daily, 
      Days 1-19) every 3 weeks. Pharmacokinetic sampling of everolimus and docetaxel 
      was done in Cycle 1. The primary endpoint was determination of the recommended 
      phase 2 doses of the combination. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled 
      (median age, 62 years; women, 11; number of prior regimens, 1 [n=13], 2 [n=6], 
      >or=3 [n=5]; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, 0 [n=6], 1 
      [n=17]). The dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were fever with grade 3/4 
      neutropenia, grade 3 fatigue, and grade 3 mucositis. None of the 7 patients 
      treated at the recommended phase 2 dose (docetaxel 60 mg/m2 and everolimus 5 mg 
      daily) experienced DLT. Everolimus area under the concentration time curve (AUC) 
      was not different with 60 or 75 mg/m2 docetaxel. Mean+/-standard deviation 
      AUC-based accumulation factors for everolimus on Days 8 and 15 were 1.16+/-0.37 
      and 1.42+/-0.42, respectively. Docetaxel Day 1 half-life was 9.4+/-3.4 hours. 
      Among 21 patients evaluable, 1 had a partial response, and 10 had disease 
      stabilization. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended phase 2 doses of docetaxel and 
      everolimus for combination therapy are 60 mg/m2 and 5 mg orally daily, 
      respectively. Promising anticancer activity has been noted.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetic characteristics of sirolimus in healthy Chinese 
      subjects and renal transplant patients.
PG  - 433-41
LID - 10.5414/CP202499 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To identify the factors affecting the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of sirolimus in 
      healthy Chinese subjects and renal transplant patients. METHODS: A population PK 
      model of sirolimus was constructed using dense data from 22 healthy volunteers 
      and sparse data from 105 renal transplant patients. RESULTS: The data were well 
      described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption. The estimates 
      of absorption rate constant (Ka), clearance (CL/F), and central volume of 
      distribution (V2/F) were 0.24 h(-1), 8.81 L/h, and 676 L, respectively. The CL/F 
      in renal transplant patients was 45.5% lower than that in healthy subjects. Based 
      on the final model, CL/F decreased significantly with increasing cyclosporine 
      (CsA) daily dose and age. A decrease of 7.3% in CL/F for every 100-mg increase in 
      the CsA daily dose and a decrease of 34.2% in CL/F for every 20-year increase in 
      age was observed. Moreover, V2/F increased significantly with increasing serum 
      creatinine in our study. However, the range of serum creatinine concentration and 
      the interindividual variability for V2/F are large. CONCLUSION: This is the first 
      study to characterize the population PKs of sirolimus using a two-compartment 
      model in healthy Chinese subjects and renal transplant patients. A decrease of 
      7.3% in the sirolimus CL/F for every 100-mg increase in the CsA daily dose and a 
      decrease of 34.2% in the sirolimus CL/F for every 20-year increase in age was 
      observed, which allowed us to better optimize sirolimus dosing regimens in 
      Chinese renal transplant patients.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacoimmunodynamic interactions between prednisolone and 
      sirolimus in rabbits.
PG  - 1888-94
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess pharmacokinetic and pharmacoimmunodynamic interactions between 
      prednisolone (Pred, I1 mg/kg) and sirolimus (Sir, 0.25 mg/kg) in rabbits. 
      METHODS: After intravenous administration, plasma concentrations of Pred and 
      corticosterone, and Sir blood concentrations were followed for 24 hours along 
      with blood granulocyte and T-helper cell counts. Ex vivo and in vitro whole blood 
      lymphocyte proliferation marked lymphocyte reactivity. RESULTS: Pred terminal 
      half-life and clearance were 1.1 hr and 0.72 l/hr/kg with no difference after 
      Sir. Sir values were 13 hr and 0.16 l/hr/kg and Pred produced no changes. 
      Corticosterone production (0-12hr) was suppressed by 55% after Pred alone or 
      combined, while Sir did not cause adrenal suppression. Blood T-helper cells and 
      granulocytes displayed circadian rhythms after placebo. Over 12 hr, T-helper cell 
      counts were decreased by Pred (40%) and Sir (19%) while granulocyte numbers 
      increased by 56% and 23%. After coadministration, cell numbers were similar to 
      Pred alone. Pred and Sir decreased lymphocyte reactivity by 41% and 56% over 24 
      hr and their combination reached 85% inhibition with additive interaction. In 
      vitro studies showed antagonistic or synergistic interactions depending on drug 
      concentration ratios. CONCLUSIONS: At therapeutic concentrations, Sir and Pred do 
      not significantly interact pharmacokinetically and have additive 
      pharmacoimmunodynamics. Thus, the therapeutic application of this combination is 
      promising.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid in kidney transplant patients receiving 
      sirolimus versus cyclosporine.
PG  - 864-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mycophenolic acid (MPA) pharmacokinetics exhibit large variability 
      in transplant recipients and may be altered due to concurrent immunosuppressants. 
      Little is known about the influence of sirolimus (SRL) on MPA pharmacokinetics in 
      kidney transplant patients. METHODS: We studied the areas under 
      concentration-time curves (AUC) for MPA in 15 patients receiving 
      immunosuppression combining SRL with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). The 
      pharmacokinetic measurements were performed in all patients using three MMF 
      dosing regimens (0.5 g twice a day, 0.75 g twice a day, 1 g twice a day). Similar 
      blood AUC profiles were also sampled from 12 patients treated with a fixed dose 
      of MMF 1 g twice a day and cyclosporine (CsA). MPA was measured using HPLC; the 
      AUC0-12 of MPA was determined by the trapezoidal method using four sampling time 
      points: C0, C1, C3, C5. RESULTS: While patients on SRL were receiving 0.75 g MMF 
      twice a day, mean AUC0-12 and C0 values of MPA were comparable to those of 
      patients receiving CsA and 1 g MMF twice a day (54.1 +/- 17.6 and 3 +/- 1.87 vs 
      51.7 +/- 16.7 mg.h/L and 2.76 +/- 1.57 mg/L, respectively). On the other hand, 
      0.5 g MMF twice a day with SRL therapy resulted in AUC0-12 and C0 values of MPA 
      of 32.3 +/- 12.6 mg.h/L and 2.32 +/- 1.72 mg/L, respectively, whereas, 1 g MMF 
      twice a day with SRL resulted in AUC0-12 and C0 values of MPA of 70.9 +/- 19.3 
      mg.h/L and 4.7 +/- 2.44 mg/L, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      demonstrate that MPA exposure in the presence of SRL is higher than that with 
      CsA. It appears that the MMF dose should be reduced to 0.75 g twice a day in 
      patients receiving SRL to obtain AUC0-12 of MPA levels comparable to that in 
      patients treated with CsA and MMF 1 g twice a day.

TI  - Two-dose-level confirmatory study of the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of 
      everolimus in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This phase I, randomized, multicenter, open-label study investigated 
      the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of the oral mammalian target of 
      rapamycin inhibitor everolimus in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumors. 
      METHODS: A total of 24 patients with advanced breast cancer (n = 6), gastric 
      cancer (n = 6), non-small cell lung cancer (n = 6), or renal cell carcinoma (n = 
      6) who were refractory to/unsuitable for standard therapy were randomized 1:1 to 
      oral everolimus 5 or 10 mg/day. Primary end points were pharmacokinetic 
      parameters and safety and tolerability. Pharmacokinetic 24-h profiles were 
      measured on day 15; trough level was measured on days 2, 8, 15, 16, and 22. 
      Tolerability was assessed continuously. This final analysis was performed after 
      all patients had received 6 months of study drug or had discontinued. RESULTS: 
      Everolimus was absorbed rapidly; median Tmax was 3 h (range, 1-4) and 2 h (range, 
      0.9-6) in the 5 and 10 mg/day groups, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
      increased dose proportionally from the 5 and 10 mg/day doses. Steady-state levels 
      were achieved by day 8 or earlier. The most common adverse events suspected to be 
      related to everolimus therapy were increased blood glucose (16.7% and 41.7%) and 
      fatigue (16.7% and 33.3%) in the everolimus 5 and 10 mg/day dose cohorts, 
      respectively. Best tumor response was stable disease in 10 (83%) and 6 (50%) 
      patients in the 5 and 10 mg/day groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus 5 
      or 10 mg/day was well tolerated in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumors. 
      The observed safety and pharmacokinetic profile of everolimus from this study 
      were consistent with previous studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Health

TI  - A Phase I Study of Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Concurrent 
      Everolimus and Buparlisib Treatment in Advanced Solid Tumors.
PG  - 2497-2505
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-2697 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Concurrent inhibition of mTOR and PI3K led to improved efficacy in 
      preclinical models and provided the rationale for this phase I study of 
      everolimus and buparlisib (BKM120) in patients with advanced solid tumor. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used the Bayesian Escalation with Overdose Control 
      design to test escalating doses of everolimus (5 or 10 mg) and buparlisib (20, 
      40, 60, 80, and 100 mg) in eligible patients. Pharmacokinetic assessment was 
      conducted using blood samples collected on cycle 1, days 8 and 15. 
      Pharmacodynamic impact on mTOR/PI3K pathway modulation evaluated in paired skin 
      biopsies collected at baseline and end of cycle 1. RESULTS: We enrolled 43 
      patients, median age of 63 (range, 39-78) years; 25 (58.1%) females, 35 (81.4%) 
      Caucasians, and 8 (18.6%) Blacks. The most frequent toxicities were 
      hyperglycemia, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and aspartate aminotransferase 
      elevation. Dose-limiting toxicities observed in 7 patients were fatigue (3), 
      hyperglycemia (2), mucositis (1), acute kidney injury (1), and urinary tract 
      infection (1). The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for the combination was 
      established as everolimus (5 mg) and buparlisib (60 mg). The best response in 27 
      evaluable patients was progressive disease and stable disease in 3 (11%) and 24 
      (89%), respectively. The median progression-free survival and overall survival 
      were 2.7 (1.8-4.2) and 9 (6.4-13.2) months. Steady-state pharmacokinetic analysis 
      showed dose-normalized maximum concentrations and AUC values for everolimus and 
      buparlisib in combination to be comparable with single-agent pharmacokinetic. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The combination of everolimus and buparlisib is safe and 
      well-tolerated at the RP2D of 5 and 60 mg on a continuous daily schedule.

TI  - Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole does not affect the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus 
      in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 566-9
AB  - AIMS: The influence of the trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole combination on the 
      steady-state pharmacokinetics of sirolimus, a potent macrocyclic 
      immunosuppressant, was studied in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: Fifteen 
      kidney transplant recipients were treated with sirolimus 8-23 mg m(-2) in 
      combination with azathioprine and prednisolone from the day of transplantation. 
      Whole blood sirolimus AUC and C(max) were determined on days 6 and 7 after 
      transplantation. On day 7, sirolimus was coadministered with the first dose of 
      trimethoprim (80 mg) and sulphamethoxazole (400 mg). RESULTS: On day 6, the mean 
      (95% confidence interval) whole blood sirolimus AUC((0-24 h)) was 1040 (846, 
      1234) ng ml(-1) and mean C(max) was 109 (88, 129) ng ml(-1). Corresponding values 
      on day 7 were AUC((0-24 h)) 1060 (826, 1293) ng ml(-1) and C(max) mean 107 (87, 
      127) ng ml(-1). The mean difference in the dose-corrected AUC((0-24 h)) was 0.40% 
      (-9.4, +10). CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole does 
      not affect the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in renal transplant patients.

TI  - A phase I and pharmacokinetic study of temsirolimus (CCI-779) administered 
      intravenously daily for 5 days every 2 weeks to patients with advanced cancer.
PG  - 5755-63
AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with advanced cancer received temsirolimus (Torisel, CCI-779), 
      a novel inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, i.v. once daily for 5 days 
      every 2 weeks to determine the maximum tolerated dose, toxicity profile, 
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Doses 
      were escalated in successive cohorts of patients using a conventional phase I 
      clinical trial design. Samples of whole blood and plasma were collected to 
      determine the pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus and sirolimus, its principal 
      metabolite. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were treated with temsirolimus (0.75-24 
      mg/m(2)/d). The most common drug-related toxicities were asthenia, mucositis, 
      nausea, and cutaneous toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose was 15 mg/m(2)/d for 
      patients with extensive prior treatment because, in the 19 mg/m(2)/d cohort, two 
      patients had dose-limiting toxicities (one with grade 3 vomiting, diarrhea, and 
      asthenia and one with elevated transaminases) and three patients required dose 
      reductions. For minimally pretreated patients, in the 24 mg/m(2)/d cohort, one 
      patient developed a dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 stomatitis and two patients 
      required dose reductions, establishing 19 mg/m(2)/d as the maximum acceptable 
      dose. Immunologic studies did not show any consistent trend toward 
      immunosuppression. Temsirolimus exposure increased with dose in a less than 
      proportional manner. Terminal half-life was 13 to 25 hours. 
      Sirolimus-to-temsirolimus exposure ratios were 0.6 to 1.8. A patient with 
      non-small cell lung cancer achieved a confirmed partial response, which lasted 
      for 12.7 months. Three patients had unconfirmed partial responses; two patients 
      had stable disease for >/=24 weeks. CONCLUSION: Temsirolimus was generally well 
      tolerated on this intermittent schedule. Encouraging preliminary antitumor 
      activity was observed.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in kidney transplant patients.
PG  - 416-28
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the dose-related pharmacokinetics of the 
      immunosuppressant agent sirolimus (formerly rapamycin) in kidney transplant 
      patients by use of two-stage and nonlinear mixed-effect model population methods. 
      METHODS: Patients (n = 36) from three centers (Germany, the United Kingdom, and 
      Sweden) who received steady-state oral doses of cyclosporine (ciclosporin) were 
      assessed after single oral administration of sirolimus at doses of 3, 5, 10, and 
      15 mg/m2. Plasma and whole blood sirolimus samples were analyzed by a 
      high-performance liquid chromatographic/mass spectrophotometric method. 
      Simultaneous fitting used biexponential functions with intercept/slope or 
      clearance/volume terms, as well as first-order absorption (ka) and a lag-time. 
      RESULTS: The nonlinear mixed-effect model method (P-Pharm) provided a better 
      characterization of sirolimus kinetics, especially for the absorption and 
      distribution phases where fewer data were available per patient. Sirolimus 
      distribution between whole blood and plasma was concentration-independent, with a 
      mean blood/plasma ratio (coefficient of variation) of 30.9 (48.5%). Elimination 
      was not influenced by dose, as shown by estimates of the terminal half-life of 63 
      hours (27.5%) and apparent oral blood clearance of 8.9 L/hr (38.2%). Sirolimus 
      distribution parameters were influenced by body weight and surface area. 
      Sirolimus was rapidly absorbed, as shown by the absorption lag-time of 0.27 hour 
      (35.1%), and ka of 2.77 hr-1 (48.4%). The concomitant administration of sirolimus 
      and cyclosporine did not reveal any pharmacokinetic interactions. CONCLUSION: 
      This report provides an initial population pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in 
      kidney transplant recipients receiving cyclosporine concurrently. Sirolimus blood 
      and plasma pharmacokinetics were biexponential and linear for doses from 3 to 15 
      mg/m2. No pharmacokinetic interaction was found between sirolimus and 
      cyclosporine.

TI  - Effect of food on everolimus absorption: quantification in healthy subjects and a 
      confirmatory screening in patients with renal transplants.
PG  - 154-9
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To quantify the influence of a high-fat meal on the oral 
      bioavailability of the immunosuppressant everolimus in a single-dose study in 
      healthy subjects and to confirm the results in a small food-effect screening 
      assessment in patients with renal transplants who were receiving multiple-dose 
      everolimus. DESIGN: Randomized, open-label, crossover, single-dose study and 
      confirmatory screening. SETTING: Phase 1 unit for the single-dose study and two 
      German hospitals for the patient screening. SUBJECTS: Twenty-four healthy male 
      volunteers; six clinically stable patients with renal transplants who were 
      originally part of a phase I dose-escalation study. INTERVENTION: The 24 healthy 
      men received everolimus 2 mg orally under fasting conditions and after a high-fat 
      meal. The six patients received everolimus 2.5 mg/day orally, in addition to 
      cyclosporine and prednisone. On two occasions, a pharmacokinetic profile was 
      obtained over the dosing interval after drug administration under fasting 
      conditions and after a high-fat meal in a randomized sequence. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      MAIN RESULTS: In the single-dose study in healthy subjects, a high-fat meal 
      delayed everolimus time to maximum concentration (Tmax) by a median 1.25 hours, 
      reduced peak blood concentration (Cmax) by 60%, and reduced area under the 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) by 16%. In the multiple-dose screening in patients 
      with renal transplants, a high-fat meal delayed Tmax by a median 1.75 hours and 
      reduced Cmax by 53% and AUC by 21%. Everolimus trough levels showed no food 
      effect, whereas the peak-trough fluctuation was dampened by 52%. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      high-fat meal modestly reduced everolimus AUC. To minimize longitudinal 
      variability in exposure, everolimus should be administered consistently either 
      with food or without food.

TI  - Safety and pharmacokinetics of ascending single doses of sirolimus (Rapamune, 
      rapamycin) in pediatric patients with stable chronic renal failure undergoing 
      dialysis.
PG  - 151-60
AB  - Sirolimus (Rapamune, rapamycin) has been shown to be an effective and safe 
      immunosuppressive drug in adult kidney transplant patients when administered 
      concomitantly with cyclosporine (CsA) and steroids. This study reports on a phase 
      1 assessment of the drug's tolerance, safety, and pharmacokinetic parameters in 
      pediatric patients. The safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of ascending single 
      doses of sirolimus oral solution were investigated in 32 clinically stable 
      pediatric patients on chronic hemodialysis (n = 26) or peritoneal dialysis (n = 
      6). Patients were divided into two age groups (5-11 and 12-18 yr), and each 
      patient received either a single dose of sirolimus (1, 3, 9, or 15 mg/m(2)) or 
      placebo. Whole blood and plasma samples were collected from each patient for the 
      determination of sirolimus pharmacokinetic parameters. Safety assessments were 
      based on reports of adverse events and results of scheduled physical 
      examinations, vital sign measurements and clinical laboratory tests. The younger 
      patients (5-11 yr) showed statistically significant increases in whole blood 
      sirolimus t(max) (p < or = 0.05) and weight-normalized CL/F (p<0.05) when 
      compared with older patients (12-18 yr). There were no differences in terminal 
      t(1/2), V(ss)/F, dose-normalized peak concentration (C(max)) and AUC, or the B/P. 
      The whole blood sirolimus mean t(max) and weight-normalized CL/F in younger 
      patients were increased by approximately 41.5% and 30%, respectively. Whole blood 
      sirolimus concentrations exhibited less than proportional increases with 
      ascending doses, which may have been caused by the large inter-subject 
      variability in CL/F, small number of subjects, and a potentially inherent 
      decrease in sirolimus bioavailability in younger pediatric patients. Adverse 
      events occurred in all dose and age groups, with headache and stomach pain being 
      the most frequently observed events. No deaths or serious adverse events were 
      reported, and no patient withdrew from the study because of an adverse event. 
      Based on an inter-study analysis, weight-normalized CL/F in the current 
      population of younger pediatric dialysis patients (5-11 yr, 544 +/- 463 mL/h/kg, 
      n = 7) was increased by 90% (p < or = 0.05) compared with healthy adults (19-36 
      yr, 287 +/- 111 mL/h/kg, n = 25). These results suggest that younger pediatric 
      patients might require an increased maintenance dose of sirolimus to achieve 
      whole blood exposures similar to those in healthy adults. Sirolimus is well 
      tolerated as a single dose of 1, 3, 9, or 15 mg/m(2).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Based upon preclinical evidence for improved antitumor activity in 
      combination, this phase I study investigated the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), 
      safety, activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biomarkers of the mammalian target 
      of rapamycin inhibitor, temsirolimus, combined with sorafenib in hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with incurable HCC and Child Pugh 
      score ≤B7 were treated with sorafenib plus temsirolimus by 3 + 3 design. The 
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) interval was 28 days. The response was assessed 
      every two cycles. PK of temsirolimus was measured in a cohort at MTD. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-five patients were enrolled. The MTD was temsirolimus 10 mg weekly plus 
      sorafenib 200 mg twice daily. Among 18 patients at MTD, DLT included grade 3 
      hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Grade 3 or 4 related 
      adverse events at MTD included hypophosphatemia (33%), infection (22%), 
      thrombocytopenia (17%), HFSR (11%), and fatigue (11%). With sorafenib, 
      temsirolimus clearance was more rapid (P < 0.05). Two patients (8%) had a 
      confirmed partial response (PR); 15 (60%) had stable disease (SD). 
      Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) declined ≥50% in 60% assessable patients. CONCLUSION: The 
      MTD of sorafenib plus temsirolimus in HCC was lower than in other tumor types. 
      HCC-specific phase I studies are necessary. The observed efficacy warrants 
      further study.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Study of Sirolimus-Eluting BioResorbable Vascular Scaffold System 
      for Treatment of De Novo Native Coronary Lesions: A Sub-Study of MeRes-1 Trial.
PG  - 364-369
LID - 10.14740/cr799 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MeRes100™ (Meril Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., Vapi, India) is a novel 
      sirolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BRS). The purpose of this 
      sub-study of MeRes-1 trial is to evaluate the systemic release of sirolimus from 
      MeRes100 BRS implanted for the treatment of de novo native coronary artery 
      lesions. METHODS: The MeRes-1 is a prospective, multicenter, first-in-human trial 
      of sirolimus-eluting MeRes100 BRS. The pharmacokinetic sub-study was conducted at 
      two Indian sites in 10 patients who were implanted with the MeRes100 BRS loaded 
      with sirolimus at a dose of 1.25 µg/mm(2). Venous blood samples were collected at 
      pre-dose and 12-time points after implantation of the scaffold. Sirolimus 
      concentration was successively analyzed using ultra-performance liquid 
      chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method. RESULTS: 
      A total of 12 scaffolds were implanted in 10 patients. Non-compartmental analysis 
      demonstrated time to reach peak concentration of sirolimus between 0.5 h to 3 h 
      after scaffold implantation. The peak concentration (C(max)) was deduced to be 
      7.47 ± 2.61 ng/mL, AUC was 436.45 ± 171.24 h·ng/mL, and the t(½) was observed at 
      98.59 ± 33.58 h. The clearance was 0.66 ± 0.16 L/h and lower limit of 
      quantification was detectable at 14.1 days. CONCLUSIONS: The MeRes-1 
      pharmacokinetic sub-study confirmed that MeRes100 BRS is safe and tolerable at 
      limited systemic exposure of sirolimus.

TI  - Effects of calcineurin inhibitors on sirolimus pharmacokinetics during staggered 
      administration in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 646-53
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of different calcineurin inhibitors on 
      sirolimus pharmacokinetics during long-term, staggered administration in kidney 
      transplant recipients. Design. Randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial. 
      SETTING: A medical center and one of its teaching hospitals in Taiwan. PATIENTS: 
      Twenty-two de novo kidney transplant recipients. INTERVENTION: Patients received 
      cyclosporine microemulsion or tacrolimus capsules twice/day in combination with 
      once-daily sirolimus solution and corticosteroids. Sirolimus was administered 6 
      hours after the morning dose of cyclosporine or tacrolimus. After receiving a 
      6-mg loading dose of sirolimus, participants received sirolimus 2 mg/day for at 
      least 7 days. Neither the cyclosporine nor the tacrolimus dosage was adjusted for 
      at least 3 days before and during blood sampling for pharmacokinetic profiling. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One patient dropped out because of 
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-related hepatotoxicity. We observed no differences 
      between the two patient groups in terms of their demographic data, renal and 
      liver function, or dosage of sirolimus during the study. During multiple-dose 
      administration, the area under the whole-blood concentration-time curve and the 
      peak and trough concentrations of sirolimus in the cyclosporine group were, 
      respectively, 1.46 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-1.71), 1.42 (95% CI 
      1.08-1.76), and 1.42 (95% CI 1.09-1.76) times higher than those of the tacrolimus 
      group, even though sirolimus was administered 6 hours after the other agents. 
      CONCLUSION: Sirolimus pharmacokinetics may change significantly when calcineurin 
      inhibitors are switched, even with staggered administration, which may not 
      completely prevent a drug interaction between cyclosporine and sirolimus 
      solution.

TI  - Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of CCI-779, a novel cytostatic cell-cycle 
      inhibitor, in combination with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in patients with 
      advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 931-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: CCI-779 is a novel ester of the immunosuppressive agent sirolimus 
      that exerts cytostatic effects by the inhibition of the translation of cell-cycle 
      regulatory proteins. We investigated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of CCI-779 in combination with leucovorin (LV) and 
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with advanced solid tumors. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Patients were treated with LV at 200 mg/m(2) as a 1-h i.v. infusion 
      directly followed by continuous 24-h i.v. infusion of 5-FU, in the first patient 
      at 2000 mg/m(2) and in subsequent patients at 2600 mg/m(2). CCI-779 was 
      administered directly prior to LV as a 30-min i.v. infusion at a starting dose of 
      15 mg/m(2) beginning at day 8 and escalated in subsequent cohorts of patients. 
      One cycle consisted of six weekly administrations followed by 1 week of rest. 
      Blood samples were drawn to assess PK of CCI-779 as well as its effect on 
      steady-state 5-FU exposures. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients entered the study, 
      the majority having tumor types for which 5-FU is used as a treatment. CCI-779 
      doses of 15, 25, 45 and 75 mg/m(2) were investigated. Skin toxicity (rash) was 
      prominent at all dose levels examined. Stomatitis was the dose-limiting toxicity 
      (DLT) for 75 mg/m(2) doses of CCI-779. Subsequently the cohort at 45 mg/m(2) was 
      expanded to a total of 15 patients, and at this dose level two treatment-related 
      deaths occurred due to mucositis with bowel perforation. Based on the toxicities 
      observed, it was decided to discontinue the study. Partial responses were 
      observed in three patients with gastrointestinal tumors. No pharmacokinetic 
      interaction between CCI-779 and 5-FU was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The safety 
      profiles of CCI-779 and 5-FU/LV suggest an overlap of drug-related toxicities, 
      and the administration of these drugs at these doses and schedule resulted in 
      unacceptable toxicity and therefore cannot be recommended. If CCI-779 is to be 
      used in combination with 5-FU/LV, other doses or schedules of administration will 
      need to be explored.

TI  - The effects of relative timing of sirolimus and cyclosporine microemulsion 
      formulation coadministration on the pharmacokinetics of each agent.
PG  - 48-53
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sirolimus and cyclosporine (INN, ciclosporin) share the same 
      cytochrome P4503A metabolic pathways, and both drugs are substrates for 
      p-glycoprotein countertransport. These factors most likely affect the 
      bioavailability of both drugs. This study served to examine whether the timing of 
      the administration of cyclosporine and sirolimus might significantly affect the 
      relative bioavailability of one or both of these drugs. METHODS: In this 
      randomized crossover trial, 24 stable kidney transplant recipients who were 
      treated after transplant with a combination of sirolimus, cyclosporine, and 
      prednisone for at least 3 months before study initiation, received individualized 
      doses of sirolimus once daily and cyclosporine in the microemulsion formulation 
      twice a day. A total of 20 patients completed the full crossover design. Patients 
      were randomized to one of two dosing schedules: 10 of the patients who completed 
      the study received the morning doses of sirolimus and cyclosporine concomitantly 
      for the first 7 days (schedule I), and from days 8 to 14 the sirolimus dose was 
      administered 4 hours after the morning cyclosporine dose. Ten of the patients 
      received the sirolimus dose 4 hours after the morning cyclosporine dose for the 
      first 7 days (schedule II), and from days 8 to 14 they received concomitant 
      morning doses of cyclosporine and sirolimus. Pharmacokinetic profiles of 
      sirolimus and cyclosporine performed on all patients on days 7, 14, and 15 
      yielded the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), peak concentration 
      (Cmax), time to Cmax (tmax), trough cyclosporine concentration (Co), and trough 
      sirolimus concentration (Co) values. RESULTS: Sirolimus AUC and sirolimus trough 
      levels were consistently and significantly higher when both cyclosporine and 
      sirolimus were administered concomitantly than when they were administered 4 
      hours apart. No effect attributable to timing of drug administration could be 
      found on cyclosporine pharmacokinetic parameters. CONCLUSION: This study shows 
      that the relative timing of administration of cyclosporine and sirolimus 
      significantly affects the blood concentrations of sirolimus.

TI  - Cinacalcet does not affect the activity of cytochrome P450 3A enzymes, a 
      metabolic pathway for common immunosuppressive agents : a randomized, open-label, 
      crossover, single-centre study in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 335-43
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cinacalcet HCl (cinacalcet) is approved for the 
      treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in subjects receiving dialysis and for 
      the reduction of hypercalcaemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. The drug 
      may also be co-administered with medications used in the renal transplantation 
      setting, such as immunosuppressants. Cinacalcet, as well as some 
      immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin, tacrolimus and sirolimus, is partially 
      metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A enzymes (CYP3A). This study aimed to 
      evaluate the potential inhibitory effects of cinacalcet on CYP3A activity using 
      midazolam as a probe substrate in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In this 
      randomized, open-label, crossover, two-treatment, two-period, single-centre 
      study, 12 healthy volunteers received either oral cinacalcet 90 mg once daily for 
      5 days plus a single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg on day 5, or a single oral dose 
      of midazolam 2 mg on day 1. Following a 10-day washout period, subjects received 
      the alternate treatment. Blood samples were collected predose and at selected 
      time points up to 24 hours after dosing with midazolam for measurement of 
      midazolam pharmacokinetic parameters. RESULTS: Eleven subjects completed the 
      study. Mean (standard deviation) midazolam maximum plasma concentrations (C(max)) 
      and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity 
      (AUC(infinity)) were 9.31 (3.09) ng/mL and 24.1 (7.7) ng . h/mL, respectively, 
      when administered in combination with cinacalcet, compared with 9.76 (2.81) ng/mL 
      and 22.8 (6.1) ng . h/mL when administered alone. The mean geometric ratios (90% 
      confidence interval) were 0.95 (0.84, 1.06) and 1.05 (0.95, 1.16) for C(max) and 
      AUC(infinity), respectively. All adverse events were mild to moderate in 
      severity, and consistent with the safety profile of cinacalcet. CONCLUSION: 
      Once-daily administration of cinacalcet did not alter the pharmacokinetics of 
      midazolam relative to administration of midazolam alone. These data suggest that 
      cinacalcet administration does not affect CYP3A activity, and thus would not have 
      an effect on any drug eliminated via CYP3A, including some commonly used 
      immunosuppressant therapies.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of SDZ RAD and cyclosporin including their metabolites in seven 
      kidney graft patients after the first dose of SDZ RAD.
PG  - 449-54
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and metabolism 
      of the new immunosuppressant SDZ RAD during concomitant therapy with cyclosporin 
      in stable renal transplant patients. Furthermore, we studied the influence of SDZ 
      RAD on the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporin at steady state levels. METHODS: SDZ 
      RAD was administered orally in different doses (0.25-15 mg day-1) to seven 
      patients, who were on standard cyclosporin-based immunosuppression. The blood 
      concentrations of both drugs including their main groups of metabolites were 
      measured simultaneously by LC/electrospray-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The mean 
      area under the blood concentration-time curve to 12 h (AUC(0,12 h)) was 4244 +/- 
      1311 microg l-1 h for cyclosporin before SDZ RAD treatment and 4683 +/- 1174 
      microg l-1 h (P = 0.106) on the day of SDZ RAD treatment (95% CI for difference 
      -126, 1003). On both study days Cmax, and tmax of cyclosporin were not 
      significantly different. The metabolite pattern of cyclosporin did not change. 
      The pharmacokinetic data of SDZ RAD dose-normalized to 1 mg SDZ RAD were as 
      follows: AUC(0,24 h): 35.4 +/- 13.1 microg l-1 h, Cmax: 7.9 +/- 2.7 microg l-1 
      and tmax: 1.5 +/- 0.9 h. The metabolites of SDZ RAD found in blood were 
      hydroxy-SDZ RAD, dihydroxy-SDZ RAD, demethyl-SDZ RAD, and a ring-opened form of 
      SDZ RAD. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of SDZ RAD did not influence significantly 
      the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporin. The most important metabolite of SDZ RAD was 
      the hydroxy-SDZ RAD, its AUC(0,24 h) being nearly half that of the parent 
      compound SDZ RAD.

TI  - Everolimus pharmacokinetics and its exposure-toxicity relationship in patients 
      with thyroid cancer.
PG  - 63-71
LID - 10.1007/s00280-016-3050-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Everolimus is a mTOR inhibitor used for the treatment of different 
      solid malignancies. Many patients treated with the registered fixed 10 mg dose 
      once daily are in need of dose interruptions, reductions or treatment 
      discontinuation due to severe adverse events. This study determined the 
      correlation between systemic everolimus exposure and toxicity. Additionally, the 
      effect of different covariates on everolimus pharmacokinetics (PK) was explored. 
      METHODS: Forty-two patients with advanced thyroid carcinoma were treated with 
      10 mg everolimus once daily. Serial pharmacokinetic sampling was performed on 
      days 1 and 15. Subsequently, a population PK model was developed using NONMEM to 
      estimate individual PK values used for analysis of an exposure-toxicity 
      relationship. Furthermore, this model was used to investigate the influence of 
      patient characteristics and genetic polymorphisms in genes coding for enzymes 
      relevant in everolimus PK. RESULTS: Patients who required a dose reduction 
      (n = 18) due to toxicity at any time during treatment had significant higher 
      everolimus exposures [mean AUC0-24 (SD) 600 (274) vs. 395 (129) µg h/L, 
      P = 0.008] than patients without a dose reduction (n = 22). A significant 
      association between everolimus exposure and stomatitis was found in the 
      four-level ordered logistic regression analysis (P = 0.047). The presence of at 
      least one TTT haplotype in the ABCB1 gene was associated with a 21 % decrease in 
      everolimus exposure. CONCLUSION: The current study showed that dose reductions 
      and everolimus-induced stomatitis were strongly associated with systemic 
      everolimus drug exposure in patients with cancer. Our findings confirm 
      observations from another study in patients with cancer and show us that 
      everolimus is a good candidate for individualized dosing in patients with cancer.

TI  - The effect of a high-fat meal on the oral bioavailability of the 
      immunosuppressant sirolimus (rapamycin).
PG  - 1155-61
AB  - The bioavailability of an oral nonaqueous solution of sirolimus was compared 
      under fasting conditions and after a high-fat meal in a randomized, two-way 
      crossover pharmacokinetic study. Healthy volunteers were administered a 15 mg 
      single dose of sirolimus on two occasions, once while fasting and once after 
      consumption of a high-fat breakfast. Whole blood concentrations of sirolimus were 
      assayed by using a validated method with high-performance liquid 
      chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric detection. Sirolimus was absorbed more 
      slowly when administered after a high-fat meal than when administered after 
      fasting, as shown by statistically significant reductions in peak concentration 
      (Cmax) and the ratio of Cmax to the area under the curve (AUC), and lengthening 
      of the time to peak concentration. The oral availability of sirolimus was 
      increased to a modest extent (35%) and in a uniform manner when administered with 
      a high-fat meal; the geometric mean ratio of the fed/fasting AUC values was 1.35, 
      with a 90% confidence interval of 1.26 to 1.46. Food had no effect on the 
      terminal half-life of sirolimus (mean values of 67 to 68 hours). The 35% increase 
      in AUC obtained after a high-fat meal appears small relative to the intersubject 
      and intrasubject variabilities observed in clinical trials. However, to minimize 
      unnecessary fluctuations in trough whole blood sirolimus concentrations, it is 
      advisable that sirolimus be administered consistently in individual patients, 
      either with or without meals.

AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to develop a nanocarrier formulation incorporating fenbendazole 
      (FEN) and rapamycin (RAPA) with strong efficacy against A549 cancer cells. As FEN 
      and RAPA are poorly soluble in water, it is difficult to apply them clinically in 
      vivo. Therefore, we attempted to resolve this problem by encapsulating these 
      drugs in polymeric micelles. METHODS: We evaluated drug synergy using the 
      combination index (CI) values of various molar ratios of FEN and RAPA. We formed 
      and tested micelles composed of different polymers. Moreover, we conducted 
      cytotoxicity, stability, release, pharmacokinetic, and biodistribution studies to 
      investigate the antitumor effects of FEN/RAPA-loaded mPEG-b-PCL micelles. 
      RESULTS: We selected mPEG-b-PCL-containing FEN and RAPA at a molar ratio of 1:2 
      because these particles were consistent in size and had high encapsulation 
      efficiency (EE, %) and drug loading (DL, %) capacity. The in vitro cytotoxicity 
      was assessed for various FEN, RAPA, and combined FEN/RAPA formulations. After 
      long-term exposures, both the solutions and the micelles had similar efficacy 
      against A549 cancer cells. The in vivo pharmacokinetic study revealed that 
      FEN/RAPA-loaded mPEG-b-PCL micelles had a relatively higher area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve from 0 to 2 h (AUC(0-2 h)) and 0 to 8 h (AUC(0-8 h)) and 
      plasma concentration at time zero (C(o)) than that of the FEN/RAPA solution. The 
      in vivo biodistribution assay revealed that the IV injection of FEN/RAPA-loaded 
      mPEG-b-PCL micelles resulted in lower pulmonary FEN concentration than the IV 
      injection of the FEN/RAPA solution. CONCLUSION: When FEN and RAPA had a 1:2 molar 
      ratio, they showed synergism. Additionally, using data from in vitro 
      cytotoxicity, synergism between a 1:2 molar ratio of FEN and RAPA was observed in 
      the micelle formulation. The FEN/RAPA-loaded mPEG-b-PCL micelle had enhanced 
      bioavailability than the FEN/RAPA solution.

TI  - Phase I, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of the anti-insulinlike growth 
      factor type 1 Receptor monoclonal antibody CP-751,871 in patients with multiple 
      myeloma.
PG  - 3196-203
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.9319 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: A phase I first-in-human study was conducted to characterize the safety, 
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties of the 
      anti-insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR) monoclonal antibody 
      CP-751,871. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After informed consent and screening, 47 
      patients with multiple myeloma in relapse or refractory phase were enrolled into 
      11 dose-escalation cohorts of CP-751,871 at doses from 0.025 to 20 mg/kg for 4 
      weeks. Patients with less than a partial response to CP-751,871 treatment were 
      eligible to receive CP-751,871 in combination with oral dexamethasone at the 
      discretion of the investigator. Treatment with CP-751,871 and rapamycin with or 
      without dexamethasone was also offered to patients enrolled in the 10 and 20 
      mg/kg cohorts with less than a partial response to initial therapy with 
      single-agent CP-751,871. RESULTS: No CP-751,871-related dose-limiting toxicities 
      were identified. Plasma CP-751,871 concentrations increased with dose and 
      concentration-time profiles were consistent with those of antibodies with 
      target-mediated disposition. Importantly, CP-751,871 administration led to a 
      decrease in granulocyte IGF-IR expression and serum insulinlike growth factor 1 
      accumulation at high doses, suggesting systemic IGF-IR inhibition. Tumor response 
      was assessed according to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation 
      criteria. Nine responses were reported in 27 patients treated with CP-751,871 in 
      combination with dexamethasone. Of interest, two of the patients with a partial 
      response were progressing from dexamethasone treatment at study entry. 
      CONCLUSION: These data indicate that CP-751,871 is well tolerated and may 
      constitute a novel agent in the treatment of multiple myeloma.

TI  - Influence of MRP2 on MPA pharmacokinetics in renal transplant recipients-results 
      of the Pharmacogenomic Substudy within the Symphony Study.
PG  - 3784-93
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr130 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MRP2 genes and mycophenolic acid (MPA) 
      pharmacokinetics in renal transplant recipients of the Symphony Pharmacogenomic 
      substudy. METHODS: Sixty-six renal transplant recipients of eight Spanish centres 
      were randomized into four branches of immunosuppressive regimen: low dose of 
      cyclosporine, standard dose of cyclosporine, tacrolimus and sirolimus, all in 
      addition to mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. Fifty-five patients were 
      genotyped for SNPs in MRP2, C24T and C3972T. Pharmacokinetic sampling was done 
      before MPA administration and up to 12 h post-dose at Day 7, 1 month and 3 months 
      post-transplant. Relationships of area under the curve (AUC) of MPA and MPAG 
      plasma sampling with the presence of MRP2 SNPs and with the immunosuppressive 
      regimens were studied. RESULTS: At steady-state conditions, MPA-reduced exposure 
      was observed in C24T variant allele in MRP2 (CC: 68.73 ± 6.78; *T: 48.12 ± 4.90, 
      P = 0.023); no significant differences linked to C3972T SNP were observed. Taking 
      into account groups of treatment, lower MPA AUC in variant allele of C24T was 
      only found under macrolides treatment with statistically significant differences 
      at Month 3 (Tac and SRL, CC: 86.52 ± 10.98 versus *T: 41.99 ± 4.82, P = 0.001; 
      CsA, CC: 52.31 ± 5.30 versus *T: 54.24 ± 8.30, P = 0.772); for C3972T, the same 
      tendency was found but differences at steady state did not reach statistical 
      significance. CONCLUSIONS: Renal transplant recipients T carriers of C24T MRP2 
      with macrolides treatment were associated with reduced MPA AUC in steady-state 
      conditions. Patients treated with cyclosporine lost the effect of this 
      polymorphism.

TI  - Sirolimus pharmacokinetics in pediatric renal transplant recipients receiving 
      calcineurin inhibitor co-therapy.
PG  - 914-9
AB  - We have previously reported sirolimus (SRL) pharmacokinetics (PK) in pediatric 
      renal transplant recipients on a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-free protocol. We 
      now report pediatric SRL PK in pediatric renal transplant patients receiving SRL 
      + CNI. SRL was dosed to achieve target trough levels between 10 and 20 ng/mL. We 
      performed 49 SRL PK profiles in pediatric renal transplant recipients receiving 
      SRL in combination with either cyclosporine (CsA; 25 profiles), or tacrolimus 
      (TCL; 24 profiles). Ten of the SRL + TCL profiles were obtained from children 
      receiving SRL on a b.i.d. dosing regimen. All other SRL profiles were q.d. 
      regimens. We calculated, the maximum concentration (C(max)), AUC, apparent 
      clearance (aCL; dose/AUC) for dose in mg/m(2), and mean residence time (MRT). SRL 
      levels were measured at 6 and 7 time points for b.i.d. and q.d. dosing, 
      respectively. Regression analysis of SRL trough values vs. AUC showed good 
      correlation in the SRL q.d. + CsA, SRL q.d. + TCL, and SRL b.i.d. + TCL groups 
      (r(2) = 0.95, 0.68, and 0.44, respectively). SRL aCL corrected for body surface 
      area was higher in children aged 0-5 yr receiving SRL with either CsA or TCL. SRL 
      dosing schedule should be tailored to each patient. Higher SRL aCL may be present 
      in younger children when administered with CNI.

LID - 1854323
AB  - To evaluate the effect of Tanreqing injection on the pharmacokinetics of 
      sirolimus in rats, a high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
      spectrometry method was developed for sirolimus assay in whole blood. Calibration 
      curve of sirolimus was acquired over a concentration ranging from 2.5 to 
      100 ng/mL with r(2)= 0.9955. The matrix effects and extraction recoveries of 
      sirolimus ranged from 144% to 152% and from 80% to 96%, respectively. The inter- 
      and intraday relative standard deviations were both <10%. The stability 
      investigation showed that the blood samples were stable for 30-day-storage at 
      -20°C, for 8 h storage at room temperature, for 24 h storage in the auto-sampler 
      at 4°C, and for three freeze-thaw cycle process. The pharmacokinetic results 
      demonstrated that the C (max), AUC, and AUMC of sirolimus in rats (7.5 mg/kg, 
      i.g.) were increased after beincoadministration with Tanreqing Injection at 2.5, 
      5.0, and 7.5 mL/kg (i.v.), respectively, or at 5 min, 2 h, and 4 h (5.0 mL/kg, 
      i.v.) after SRL dosing, respectively. For the first time, the results proved the 
      herb-drug interaction between Tanreqing Injection and sirolimus and accordingly 
      suggested avoiding concurrent reception of those two drugs for patients.

TI  - Comparative Sirolimus Pharmacokinetics After Single-Dose Administration of Two 
      Prototype 0.5-mg Tablets in Healthy Volunteers.
PG  - 52-6
LID - 10.1177/2160763X12438746 [doi]
AB  - Availability of a lower dose tablet would add to the dosing flexibility of 
      currently available 1- and 2-mg sirolimus tablets for optimal concentrations and 
      patient compliance. A randomized, 3-period crossover study was conducted in 30 
      fasting healthy volunteers (29 men, aged 31 ± 8 years, weight 79 ± 12 kg). 
      Subjects were given 5 mg of sirolimus, either as doses of the 0.5-mg 
      nonshellac-core prototype, 0.5-mg shellac-core prototype, or approved 1-mg 
      tablet. Whole blood samples were collected at selected time points for 144 hours 
      after dosing and analyzed using LC/MS/MS assay. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic 
      analysis was performed, followed by bioequivalence assessment. Twenty-four 
      subjects completed all dosing periods, and no formulation-associated adverse 
      events were reported. Ratios of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ), area under 
      the concentration-time curve to the last measured concentration (AUCT ), and area 
      under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC) for the 
      nonshellac-core prototype compared with the 1-mg tablet were within the 80% to 
      125% range dictated by bioequivalence conventions. Similar results were observed 
      when comparing the ratios of AUCT and AUC for the shellac-core prototype, while 
      90% confidence interval of the ratio of Cmax values was 105% to 129%. Within the 
      context of clinical equivalence standards established by a phase 3 study 
      comparing liquid to tablet formulations, it was concluded that both prototypes 
      were clinically bioequivalent to the reference formulation.

TI  - Effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of everolimus administered by 
      different routes in rats.
PG  - 517-23
LID - 10.1002/bdd.687 [doi]
AB  - The effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of everolimus was investigated 
      in rats. Ten minutes after an intravenous or intraintestinal administration of 
      itraconazole, everolimus was delivered intravenously (0.2 mg/kg) or 
      intraintestinally (0.5 mg/kg). Blood concentrations of everolimus were measured 
      up to 240 min, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Intraintestinally 
      administered itraconazole (20 mg/kg) significantly increased the area under the 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) of intraintestinally administered everolimus about 
      4.5-fold, but even at 50 mg/kg did not affect the AUC of intravenously 
      administered everolimus. However, intravenously administered itraconazole (50 
      mg/kg) increased the AUC of both intraintestinally and intravenously administered 
      everolimus approximately 2-fold. Using a value for hepatic blood flow from the 
      literature (50 ml/min/kg), the apparent intestinal and hepatic extraction of 
      everolimus without itraconazole was calculated as about 80% and 13%, 
      respectively. Intraintestinally administered itraconazole (20 mg/kg) changed the 
      apparent intestinal extraction by 0.26-fold from 0.829 to 0.215, but the hepatic 
      availability of everolimus was almost unchanged after the intravenous or 
      intraintestinal administration of itraconazole even at a dose of 50 mg/kg from 
      0.871 to 0.923 or 0.867, respectively. In conclusion, intraintestinally 
      administered itraconazole dramatically increased the AUC of everolimus delivered 
      intraintestinally by inhibiting the intestinal first-pass extraction of this 
      drug.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics of everolimus in de novo kidney transplant patients 
      receiving tacrolimus: an analysis from the randomized ASSET study.
PG  - 337-45
LID - 10.12659/AOT.890673 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacokinetic data regarding a drug-drug interaction between 
      everolimus and tacrolimus are sparse. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a pharmacokinetic 
      substudy of the randomized ASSET trial, 46 de novo kidney transplant patients 
      receiving very low (1.5-3 ng/mL) or low (4-7 ng/mL) tacrolimus exposure after 
      month 3, both with everolimus and steroids, provided area under the curve (AUC) 
      concentration profiles at day 5 and months 1, 3, and 12. RESULTS: At month 12, 
      mean values for tacrolimus trough concentration (C0), peak concentration (Cmax), 
      and AUC0-12 in the very low tacrolimus group were approximately half that in the 
      low tacrolimus group, but everolimus dose, C0, Cmax, and AUC0-12 were virtually 
      identical in both groups. In a cross-study comparison with data at months 1 and 3 
      from the pharmacokinetic substudy of the A2307 trial, in which patients received 
      cyclosporine, mean values for everolimus C0, Cmax and AUC0-12 were similar to 
      those in the ASSET trial but the everolimus dose needed to achieve similar 
      exposure was 1.5- to 2-fold higher with concomitant tacrolimus versus 
      cyclosporine. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus exposure is unaffected when tacrolimus 
      exposure is down-titrated within the trough concentration range of 1.5-7 ng/mL. 
      Higher doses of everolimus are needed to achieve a given exposure when combined 
      with tacrolimus versus cyclosporine.

TI  - Influence of everolimus on steady-state pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine in 
      maintenance renal transplant patients.
PG  - 781-91
AB  - To investigate possible interactions of the novel immunosuppressant everolimus 
      with cyclosporine, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
      dose-escalating phase I study was performed. Everolimus regimens (0.75-10 mg/d) 
      were administered for 28 days to stable renal allograft recipients receiving the 
      microemulsion form of cyclosporine. Steady-state cyclosporine profiles were 
      assessed at baseline on day 0 (cyclosporine alone) and on day 21 with everolimus 
      on steady state. By day 21, mean dose-normalized cyclosporine AUC0-12 increased 
      by 15% in patients receiving placebo. In everolimus-treated patients, mean 
      increases in cyclosporine AUC0-12 ranged from 7% to 43%, which were not 
      significantly different across all dosing cohorts including placebo. Linear 
      regression of everolimus AUC on day 21 versus the increase in cyclosporine 
      AUC0-12 yielded a slope not significantly different from a horizontal line (P = 
      ns). In conclusion, these results suggest that steady-state everolimus exposure 
      over the wide range assessed in this study did not affect steady-state 
      cyclosporine pharmacokinetics.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interaction between verapamil and everolimus in healthy subjects.
PG  - 434-7
AB  - AIMS: We sought to define the influence of verapamil, an inhibitor of CYP3A and 
      P-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of everolimus, a substrate of this enzyme 
      and transporter. METHODS: This was a two-period, single-sequence, crossover study 
      in 16 healthy subjects. In period 1 subjects received a single 2 mg oral dose of 
      everolimus. In period 2 they received verapamil 80 mg three times daily for a 
      total of 6 days and a single 2 mg dose of everolimus co-administered on the 
      second day of verapamil therapy. RESULTS: During verapamil co-administration, 
      everolimus C(max) increased 2.3-fold (90% CI, 1.9, 2.7) from 21 +/- 8 to 47 +/- 
      18 ng ml(-1) and AUC increased 3.5-fold (90% CI, 3.1, 3.9) from 115 +/- 45 to 392 
      +/- 142 ng ml(-1) h. Everolimus half-life was only prolonged to a minor extent 
      (32 +/- 6 vs. 37 +/- 6 h). Verapamil predose concentrations doubled from 32 +/- 
      16 to 74 +/- 42 ng ml(-1) after single dose administration of everolimus. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Multiple dosing with verapamil increased blood concentrations of 
      everolimus after a single dose by an average 3.5-fold. During verapamil 
      treatment, dose reduction for everolimus should be made guided by blood 
      monitoring and for verapamil by blood pressure monitoring.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in Thai healthy volunteers.
PG  - S157-62
AB  - Sirolimus, a novel immunosuppressive drug, has been used in kidney transplant 
      recipients to minimize calcineurine inhibitor (CNI) and steroid toxicities. 
      Likewise CNI, Sirolimus's pharmacokinetics have both inter and intra-individual 
      pharmacokinetic variations. Due to ethnic differences, the recommended oral 
      loading dose of 6 mg and oral maintenance dose of 2 mg per day for Caucasian 
      patients and oral loading dose of 10 mg and oral maintenance dose of 5 mg per day 
      for African-American patients may not be appropriate for Asian recipients. We, 
      therefore conducted the pharmacokinetic study of sirolimus in Thai population, 
      aimed to delineate the appropriate sirolimus dose for further clinical use. The 
      study was performed in 12 healthy Thai volunteers. After an over night fasting, a 
      single oral dose of 6 mg sirolimus was given. The complete pharmacokinetic study 
      was done by UVhigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) to measure the 
      whole blood sirolimus level at 0.5 hour after the dose (C0.5) and then C1, C1.5, 
      C2, C2.5, C3, C4, C6, C8, C12, and C24 hours. A complete area under the 
      concentration time curve from 0-24 hours (AUC(0-24 hr)) was calculated by using 
      the trapezoidal rule. The mean (+/- SD) time to maximal concentration (Tmax) was 
      1.45 +/- 0.5 hr (range 1-3 hrs). The maximal (Cm) and minimal plasma 
      concentration (Ctroug) for sirolimus were 25.3 +/- 6.1 ng/ml (range 18.10 - 40 
      ng/ml) and 4.47 +/- 0.57 ng/ml (range 2.90 - 7.20) ng/ml respectively. The 
      AUC(0-24 hr) were 187.9 +/- 48.2 ng * hr/ml (range 151.3 - 294.8 ng * hr/ml). 
      Sirolimus level at 4 hr post-dose had the best of correlation with AUC(0-24 hr) 
      (Pearson correlation = 0.76, p < 0.007). One volunteer had a very high sirolimus 
      level. This subject's pharmacokinetic data showed AUC(0-24 hr) of 256 ng * hr/ml 
      and Cmax of 40 ng/ml. In conclusion, the oral loading dose of 6 mg of sirolimus 
      in Thai volunteers did not achieve the recommended therapeutic level (5-10 ng/ml) 
      in most subjects. There are differences in pharmacokinetics of sirolimus between 
      Thais and Caucasians.

TI  - Influence of hepatic impairment on everolimus pharmacokinetics: implications for 
      dose adjustment.
PG  - 425-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the influence of hepatic impairment on the 
      pharmacokinetics of the immunosuppressant everolimus to provide dose 
      recommendations for clinical use. METHODS: In this open-label, single-dose, 
      case-control study, 8 subjects with liver cirrhosis classed as moderate hepatic 
      impairment (Child-Pugh score, 7-9) and 8 demographically matched healthy control 
      subjects received a single oral 2-mg dose of everolimus. Routine safety 
      assessments were made, and blood samples were taken for determination of 
      everolimus concentrations and protein binding. RESULTS: The apparent clearance of 
      everolimus was significantly reduced by 53% in subjects with moderate hepatic 
      impairment compared with healthy subjects (9.1 +/- 3.1 versus 19.4 +/- 5.8 L/h). 
      This was manifested by a 115% higher area under the blood concentration-time 
      curve (AUC) (245 +/- 91 versus 114 +/- 45 ng. h/ml) and 84% prolonged half-life 
      (79 +/- 42 versus 43 +/- 18 hours) in subjects with hepatic impairment. The rate 
      of absorption of everolimus was not altered by hepatic impairment on the basis of 
      the maximum blood concentration (C(max)) and time to reach C(max) (t(max)). 
      Protein binding was similar in the two groups (73.8% +/- 3.6% versus 73.5% +/- 
      2.4%). A significant positive correlation of the everolimus AUC with bilirubin 
      level (r = 0.86) and a significant negative correlation with albumin 
      concentration (r = 0.72) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The dose of everolimus should 
      initially be reduced by half in patients with mild and moderate hepatic 
      impairment on the basis of the Child-Pugh classification. Therapeutic monitoring 
      would be a helpful adjunct to subsequent titration of everolimus exposure in this 
      subpopulation. Everolimus has not been assessed in patients with severe hepatic 
      impairment.

TI  - Longitudinal assessment of everolimus in de novo renal transplant recipients over 
      the first post-transplant year: pharmacokinetics, exposure-response 
      relationships, and influence on cyclosporine.
PG  - 48-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to characterize the steady-state pharmacokinetics of 
      everolimus and cyclosporine (INN, ciclosporin) when coadministered in de novo 
      kidney allograft recipients during the first year after transplantation. METHOD: 
      This study was a multicenter randomized double-blind study of 101 patients who 
      were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive everolimus tablets at doses of 0.5 mg, 1 
      mg, or 2 mg twice daily with cyclosporine and prednisone. Blood sampling for the 
      pharmacokinetics of everolimus and cyclosporine was performed on day 1, on weeks 
      1, 2, 3, and 4, and on months 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Everolimus dose-proportionality 
      and stability over time were assessed in the context of linear regression and 
      ANOVA models. Everolimus exposure-response relationships between area under the 
      blood concentration-time curve (AUC) and changes in platelets, leukocytes, and 
      lipids were explored with the median-effect model. Potential differences in 
      cyclosporine dosing and pharmacokinetics at different levels of everolimus 
      exposure were assessed in the context of ANOVA. RESULTS: Everolimus steady state 
      was reached on or before day 7, with a median 3-fold accumulation of drug 
      exposure compared with that after the first postoperative dose. Both steady-state 
      maximum concentration and AUC were dose proportional over the full dose range 
      when assessed on day 1, as well as for the full duration of the study at steady 
      state. There was evidence for longitudinal stability in AUC of everolimus during 
      the course of the study. The interindividual pharmacokinetic variability for AUC 
      was 85.4% and intraindividual, interoccasion variability was 40.8%. Age (range, 
      17-69 years), weight (range, 49-106 kg), and sex (65 men and 36 women) were not 
      significant contributors to variability. There was an increasing incidence of 
      transient thrombocytopenia (< or =100 x 10(9)/L) with increasing everolimus AUC 
      (P = .03). Cyclosporine doses, trough concentrations, and AUC exhibited similar 
      temporal patterns during the course of the study regardless of the 
      co-administered everolimus dose level (P = .13, .82, and .76, respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus exhibited dose-proportional, stable exposure during the 
      first post-transplant year. For a 4-fold range of everolimus doses there were no 
      differential effects on cyclosporine dosing or pharmacokinetics.

TI  - The oral mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) in combination with letrozole in 
      patients with advanced breast cancer: results of a phase I study with 
      pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 84-91
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of combined 
      treatment with letrozole and the oral mTOR inhibitor RAD001 in patients with 
      metastatic breast cancer stable or progressing after > or = 4 months on letrozole 
      alone. METHODS: Eighteen patients received letrozole (2.5 mg/day) and RAD001 at 5 
      mg/day (cohort 1) or 10 mg/day (cohort 2). In the absence of DLT in cohort 1, 
      cohort 2 was expanded to 12 patients to obtain additional safety and PK data. 
      RESULTS: Most common adverse events were stomatitis (50.0% of patients), fatigue 
      (44.4%), anorexia and/or decreased appetite (44.4%), diarrhoea (38.9%), headache 
      (33.3%) and rash (33.3%). There was 1 DLT, a grade 3 thrombocytopaenia in cohort 
      2. No clinically relevant PK interaction was detected. Seven patients received 
      the combination therapy for >6 months. One patient had a complete response, and 
      one had a 28% reduction in liver metastases, both in cohort 2. CONCLUSION: Daily 
      therapy with RAD001 plus letrozole is promising: the results suggest anti-tumour 
      activity with no PK interactions. The overall safety profile of the combination 
      is consistent with that expected for RAD001 monotherapy. A daily dose of RAD001 
      10mg is recommended for further trials.

TI  - A Limited Sampling Strategy to Estimate Exposure of Everolimus in Whole Blood and 
      Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells in Renal Transplant Recipients Using 
      Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling and Bayesian Estimators.
PG  - 1459-1469
LID - 10.1007/s40262-018-0646-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Intracellular exposure of everolimus may be a better 
      marker of therapeutic effect than trough whole blood concentrations. We aimed to 
      develop pharmacokinetic population models and Bayesian estimators based on a 
      limited sampling strategy for estimation of dose interval exposures of everolimus 
      in whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in renal transplant 
      recipients. METHODS: Full whole blood and PBMC concentration-time profiles of 
      everolimus were obtained from 12 stable renal transplant recipients on two 
      different occasions, 4 weeks apart. The dataset was treated as 24 individual 
      profiles and split into a development dataset (n = 20) and a validation dataset 
      (n = 4). The pharmacokinetic model was developed using non-parametric modeling 
      and its performances and those of the derived Bayesian estimator were evaluated 
      in the validation set. RESULTS: A structural two-compartment model with 
      first-order elimination and two absorption phases described by a sum of two gamma 
      distributions were developed. None of the tested covariates (age, sex, albumin, 
      hematocrit, fat-free mass and genetic variants such as CYP3A5*1, ABCB1 haplotype, 
      PPARA*42, PPARA*48, and POR*28) were retained in the final model. A limited 
      sampling schedule of two whole blood samples at 0 and 1.5 h and one PBMC sample 
      at 1.5 h post dose provided accurate estimates of the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) in comparison with the trapezoidal reference AUC 
      (relative bias ± standard deviation = - 3.9 ± 10.6 and 4.1 ± 12.3% for whole 
      blood and PBMC concentrations, respectively). CONCLUSION: The developed model 
      allows simultaneous and accurate prediction of everolimus exposure in whole blood 
      and PBMCs, and supplies a base for a feasible exploration of the relationships 
      between intracellular exposure and therapeutic effects in prospective trials.

TI  - Effect of everolimus on the pharmacokinetics of octreotide long-acting repeatable 
      in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors: An analysis of the randomized 
      phase III RADIANT-2 trial.
PG  - 462-468
LID - 10.1002/cpt.559 [doi]
AB  - In the RADIANT-2 trial, addition of everolimus to octreotide long-acting 
      repeatable (LAR) exhibited a clinically meaningful 5.1-month improvement in 
      progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced functional 
      neuroendocrine tumors. In this study, we characterized the effects of everolimus 
      co-administration on octreotide LAR pharmacokinetics and its relationship with 
      efficacy and safety. At least one evaluable blood everolimus and plasma 
      octreotide predose minimum concentration (C(min) ) was available for 182 patients 
      and 294 patients, respectively. Concomitant everolimus administration increased 
      octreotide C(min) with a geometric mean ratio (everolimus/placebo) of 1.47 (90% 
      confidence interval [CI] = 1.32-1.64). Risk for progression was consistently 
      reduced when everolimus C(min) was increased twofold, regardless of octreotide 
      exposure (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.46-1.18; HR = 0.54; 95% CI = 
      0.32-0.92 for 6 ng/mL and 4 ng/mL octreotide, respectively). Risk for pulmonary 
      or metabolic events was associated with increased everolimus C(min) . 
      Co-administration of everolimus plus octreotide LAR increased octreotide C(min) , 
      which did not impact efficacy.

TI  - Influence of everolimus on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in Japanese renal 
      transplant patients.
PG  - 484-90
LID - 10.1111/iju.13081 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine whether a trough concentration of everolimus in the 
      therapeutic range of 3-5 ng/mL affects the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in 
      renal transplant patients. METHODS: A total of 52 Japanese renal transplant 
      patients receiving tacrolimus were enrolled in this study. In 28 of them, 
      everolimus was co-administered on day 14 after surgery. Changes in the 
      dose-adjusted blood trough concentration of tacrolimus from day 14 to 28 after 
      surgery were investigated. RESULTS: The dose-adjusted blood trough concentration 
      of tacrolimus on day 28 was affected by CYP3A5*3/*3 and hemoglobin level (P < 
      0.001 and P = 0.007), but not by everolimus (P = 0.171). In addition, there was 
      no change in the dose-adjusted blood trough concentration of tacrolimus in 
      patients before or after everolimus coadministration (P = 0.165). On day 28, 
      there was no correlation between the rate of change in the dose-adjusted blood 
      trough concentration of tacrolimus and the blood trough concentration or area 
      under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h for everolimus after 
      initiation of combination therapy (r = 0.341, P = 0.076 and r = 0.234, P = 
      0.231). CONCLUSIONS: A pharmacokinetic interaction between tacrolimus and 
      everolimus was not observed clinically in renal transplant patients. Safe and 
      reliable immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplant patients might be achieved 
      using a combination of tacrolimus and everolimus.

TI  - Effect of intestinal and hepatic first-pass extraction on the pharmacokinetics of 
      everolimus in rats.
PG  - 469-75
AB  - The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the effects of intestinal 
      and hepatic extraction on the pharmacokinetics of everolimus in rats. Everolimus 
      was administered intravenously, intraportally or intraintestinally in order to 
      separately evaluate the intestinal and hepatic first-pass extraction. 
      Cyclosporine or tacrolimus was administered into rat intestines, and after 10 min 
      everolimus pharmacokinetics were evaluated. The blood concentrations of 
      everolimus were measured by the high-performance liquid chromatography with 
      tandem mass spectrometry. Total body clearance of everolimus was constant in the 
      dosage from 0.2 to 1.0 mg/kg. The bioavailability after intraportal and 
      intraintestinal administration were 48.0% and 21.2%, respectively. Concomitantly 
      administered cyclosporine (5 mg/kg) , but not tacrolimus (1 mg/kg), significantly 
      decreased the total body clearance of everolimus compared with the control, and 
      also increased the bioavailabilty of everolimus after intraintestinal 
      administration 1.75-fold. Cyclosporine significantly increased the area under the 
      blood concentration-time curve of everolimus after the intraintestinal constant 
      infusion 3-fold, and increased that after the intraportal constant infusion only 
      1.35-fold. In conclusion, the intestine as well as liver contributes to the 
      first-pass extraction for everolimus in rats. Intestinally administered 
      cyclosporine inhibited the intestinal extraction of everolimus more than its 
      hepatic extraction.

TI  - Everolimus in pediatric de nova renal transplant patients.
PG  - 2082-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The steady-state pharmacokinetics of everolimus were longitudinally 
      assessed in pediatric de novo kidney allograft recipients during a 6-month 
      period. METHODS: Nineteen patients received everolimus 0.8 mg/m2 (maximum 1.5 mg) 
      twice daily as a dispersible tablet in water in addition to cyclosporine and 
      corticosteroids. Everolimus and cyclosporine trough concentrations were obtained 
      on days 3, 5, 6, and 7 and at months 1, 2, 3, and 6; an everolimus 
      pharmacokinetic profile was obtained on day 7 and month 3. RESULTS: There were 9 
      boys and 10 girls with a median age of 9.9 (range, 1-16) years. Steady-state 
      pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows (median, range): C(min) (trough 
      level), 4.7 (2.3- 9.5) ng/mL; peak concentration, 13.5 (5.9-22.2) ng/mL; area 
      under the concentration-time curve (AUC), 77 (53-147) ng x hr/mL; and apparent 
      oral clearance, 10.2 (5.5-15.6) L/hr/m2. Clearance (unadjusted for demographic 
      factors) was positively correlated with age (r=0.66), body surface area (r=0.68), 
      and weight (r=0.67). There were no trends in C(min) or AUC versus patient age 
      when everolimus was dosed on a mg/m2 basis. Everolimus C(min) were stable over 
      time with median values of 3.9, 3.4, and 3.1 ng/mL at months 1, 3, and 6, 
      respectively. Intra- and interpatient variability in AUC was 29% and 35%, similar 
      to that in adults. During the observation period, eight patients maintained 
      stable AUCs and nine patients had increases or decreases, generally between 30% 
      and 50% compared with the AUC at week 1. The concurrent median cyclosporine 
      C(min) were generally at the lower end of conventional target ranges: 156, 83, 
      and 69 ng/mL at months 1, 3, and 6, respectively. There were no graft losses and 
      only three mild or moderate, reversible rejection episodes occurred. Everolimus 
      was generally safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the use of 
      body surface area-adjusted dosing for everolimus in pediatric patients. Although 
      exposure is generally stable over time with moderate variability in AUC, 
      therapeutic monitoring would be a helpful adjunct for individualizing everolimus 
      exposure, assessing regimen adherence, and adjusting doses as the child matures.

TI  - Effect of rifampin on apparent clearance of everolimus.
PG  - 981-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of the CYP3A4 enzyme inducer rifampin on the 
      pharmacokinetics of the immunosuppressant everolimus to provide guidance for 
      their coadministration. METHODS: In this open-label, single-sequence, crossover 
      study, 12 healthy subjects received a single oral 4-mg dose of everolimus alone 
      and again after an 8-day pretreatment with rifampin 600 mg/d. Urinary excretion 
      of 6beta-hydroxycortisol was measured at various time points during rifampin 
      treatment as a marker of CYP3A4 induction. RESULTS: Urine excretion of 
      6beta-hydroxycortisol was significantly elevated during treatment with rifampin 
      compared with prestudy, indicating enzyme induction. When everolimus was 
      coadministered during rifampin treatment, the apparent clearance of everolimus 
      was significantly increased, on average by 172%. This was manifested as a 
      decrease in maximum concentration in all subjects, on average by 58% (range 
      14-73%). The AUC remained unaffected in 1 subject (although 6beta-hydroxycortisol 
      indicated enzyme induction) and decreased in the other 11 subjects. The average 
      decrease in AUC in the full study population was 63% (range 0-82%). Everolimus 
      half-life was reduced significantly, from an average of 32 hours to 24 hours. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In everolimus-treated patients for whom rifampin is indicated, 
      alternative agents with less enzyme induction potential than rifampin could be 
      considered. Alternatively, the dose of everolimus could be individually titrated 
      based on everolimus therapeutic drug monitoring during rifampin therapy.

      hepatic allografts.
PG  - 589-97
LID - 10.1007/s00228-011-1172-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine sirolimus steady-state pharmacokinetics, and to assess the 
      relationship between time-normalized trough sirolimus concentration (C(min,TN)) 
      and evidence of efficacy (rejection and death) and adverse reactions (stomatitis 
      and pneumonia) in liver allograft patients. METHODS: Dense sampling of sirolimus 
      was performed over a single daily-dosing interval in 11 hepatic allograft 
      recipients on day 28 and at 3 months after start of treatment. Serial trough 
      concentration sampling was performed in 380 hepatic allograft recipients on days 
      1, 7, 14, 28, 42, 60, 90, 180, 270 and 360 after start of treatment. Occurrence 
      of stomatitis, pneumonia, rejection, and death were collected for 360 days after 
      start of treatment. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed in 
      the 11 densely sampled patients; C(min,TN) was determined in the 380 patients. 
      RESULTS: Mean maximum concentration (C(max)), time to C(max) (t(max)), area under 
      the curve for the given dose interval (AUC(tau)), and whole blood oral clearance 
      at 3 months were 20.8 ± 7.6 ng/mL, 3 ± 1 h, 338 ± 144 ng·h/mL, and 10.0 ± 5.6 
      L/hr, respectively. In the 11 densely sampled patients, linear regression showed 
      that C(min,TN) was highly predictive of AUC(tau) (r² = 0.77, P < 0.0001) at each 
      analysis time point. Logistic regression showed a relationship between C(min,TN) 
      in the 380 patients and pneumonia occurrence, but not between C(min,TN) and 
      stomatitis, rejection, or death. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the pharmacokinetic 
      profile of sirolimus in hepatic allograft patients was consistent with that of 
      renal transplantation recipients. With the exception of pneumonia, no correlation 
      was observed between C(min,TN) and the occurrence of adverse events of interest.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil in renal transplant recipients 
      receiving standard-dose or low-dose cyclosporine, low-dose tacrolimus or low-dose 
      sirolimus: the Symphony pharmacokinetic substudy.
PG  - 2269-76
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp162 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA), the primary active metabolite of 
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), is correlated with therapeutic efficacy of MMF but 
      varies depending on the concomitantly administered immunosuppressive drugs. 
      METHODS: A 3-month pharmacokinetic substudy of the prospective, randomized, 
      multicentre, open-label Symphony study was performed. Eighty-three adult renal 
      transplant patients received standard-dose cyclosporine, MMF 2 g/day and 
      corticosteroids, or daclizumab induction, MMF 2 g/day and corticosteroids plus 
      low-dose cyclosporine, low-dose tacrolimus or low-dose sirolimus. The area under 
      the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-12)) of MPA and its metabolites between 
      treatment groups was compared. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed before MMF 
      administration and at 20, 40, 75 min; 2, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h post-dose on Day 7 
      and Months 1 and 3. RESULTS: Compared with standard-dose cyclosporine, patients 
      receiving low-dose tacrolimus or low-dose sirolimus had significantly higher 
      AUC(0-12) values for MPA at Day 7 and Month 1 and for free MPA at Day 7, and 
      significantly lower AUC(0-12) values for 7-O-MPA-glucuronide (MPAG) at Month 1 
      and for acyl-glucuronide at Months 1 and 3 (P < 0.05). AUC(0-12) of MPA and free 
      MPA was significantly greater with low-dose tacrolimus and low-dose sirolimus 
      than with low-dose cyclosporine in the first month (P < 0.05). The ratio of MPA 
      to MPAG exposure was significantly higher in the three low-dose groups than in 
      the standard-dose cyclosporine group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Standard- and 
      low-dose cyclosporine reduces the exposure of MPA and free MPA compared to 
      low-dose tacrolimus or low-dose sirolimus in patients given the same dose of MMF.

TI  - Phase I study evaluating the combination of lapatinib (a Her2/Neu and EGFR 
      inhibitor) and everolimus (an mTOR inhibitor) in patients with advanced cancers: 
      South West Oncology Group (SWOG) Study S0528.
PG  - 1089-96
LID - 10.1007/s00280-013-2297-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, can 
      augment the efficacy of HER inhibitors in preclinical studies. This study was 
      conducted to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination of 
      lapatinib, a Her1 and 2 inhibitor, and everolimus and to describe its anti-tumor 
      activity in the Phase I setting. METHODS: In Part I, dose escalation to define 
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was performed. In Part II, PK of both drugs were 
      analyzed to assess drug-drug interaction. RESULTS: Twenty-three evaluable 
      patients with advanced cancers were treated on six different dose levels in Part 
      I of the study. The dose-limiting toxicities were diarrhea, rash, mucositis, and 
      fatigue. The MTD of the combination was 1,250 mg of lapatinib and 5 mg of 
      everolimus once daily. In Part II of the study, 54 patients were treated with the 
      combination at the MTD. The mean everolimus time to maximum concentration was 
      increased by 44 %, and mean clearance was decreased by 25 % when co-administered 
      with lapatinib, though these differences were not statistically significant. 
      There was no significant influence on the PK of lapatinib by everolimus. Two 
      patients achieved a partial response [thymic cancer (45+ months) and breast 
      cancer (unconfirmed PR; 7 months)]; 11 patients attained stable disease of at 
      least 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Lapatinib and everolimus are well tolerated at doses 
      of 1,250 and 5 mg po daily, respectively. Stable disease ≥4 months/PR was 
      achieved in 13 of 78 patients (17 %).

PG  - 137-45
LID - 10.1111/j.1472-8206.2008.00644.x [doi]
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate time-dependent pharmacokinetic changes and 
      drug interactions over the first 6 months after transplantation in kidney 
      transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus (TAC), prednisone (PRED) and 
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or sirolimus (SRL). Pharmacokinetic assessments were 
      carried out at day 7 and months 1, 3, and 6 in kidney transplant recipients 
      receiving TAC plus PRED with either MMF (2 g/day, n = 13) or SRL (15 mg loading 
      dose, 5 mg for 7 days followed by 2 mg/day, n = 12). There were no differences in 
      the main demographic characteristics or in mean PRED doses during the first 6 
      months after transplant. From day 7 to month 6, there was a 65% increase in TAC 
      dose corrected exposure (dose corrected area under the curve; AUC) in patients 
      receiving MMF (P = 0.005) and a 59% increase in TAC dose corrected exposure in 
      patients receiving SRL (P = 0.008). From day 7 to month 6, there was a 72% 
      increase in mycophenolate dose corrected exposure (P = 0.001) and a 65% increase 
      in SRL dose corrected exposure (P = 0.008). TAC dose corrected exposure was 23% 
      lower in patients receiving SRL compared with MMF (P = 0.012) on average over the 
      study period. PRED dose reduction was associated with increase in TAC (in 
      patients receiving SRL, P = 0.040) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) (P = 0.070) drug 
      exposures. Tercile distribution of TAC drug exposure showed a positive 
      correlation with mean SRL exposures (P = 0.016). Conversely, tercile distribution 
      of SRL drug exposure showed a positive correlation with mean TAC exposures (P = 
      0.004). Time-dependent increases in TAC, MPA and SRL drug exposures occur up to 6 
      months after transplantation. Drug-to-drug interactions indicate that intense 
      therapeutic drug monitoring is required to avoid under- or 
      over-immunosuppression.

TI  - Phase I study for ridaforolimus, an oral mTOR inhibitor, in Japanese patients 
      with advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 1099-105
LID - 10.1007/s00280-011-1788-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ridaforolimus is a non-prodrug mTOR inhibitor. The safety, 
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of oral ridaforolimus were assessed 
      in Japanese patients with refractory solid tumors. METHODS: Ridaforolimus (20 or 
      40 mg) was administered as a single dose on Day 1, followed by once daily dosing 
      five times a week for a 3-week cycle beginning on Day 8. Full PK sampling was 
      performed on Days 1 and 26. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (7 at 20 mg and 6 at 40 
      mg) were enrolled. The median treatment duration was 82 days. The most common 
      drug-related adverse events were stomatitis, hypertriglyceridemia, and 
      proteinuria. Two patients had dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 stomatitis at 20 
      mg, and grade 3 anorexia and vomiting at 40 mg). Four patients had grade 1 
      interstitial pneumonitis. Ridaforolimus in the whole blood was rapidly absorbed 
      and slowly eliminated with a half-life of approximately 56-58 h after a single 
      dose. Two patients (with non-small cell lung cancer and angiosarcoma, 
      respectively) achieved a partial response, and five patients (one with thymic 
      cancer and four with soft tissue sarcomas) had a stable disease for ≥ 16 weeks. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Ridaforolimus was well tolerated up to a dose of 40 mg in Japanese 
      patients. Preliminary evidence of antitumor activity was observed for patients 
      with solid tumors. Further investigation at this dose is warranted.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and tumor distribution characteristics of temsirolimus in 
      patients with recurrent malignant glioma.
PG  - 7401-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To characterize the pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus and its major 
      metabolite, sirolimus, in patients receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs 
      (EIAED) compared with patients receiving non-EIAEDs. An additional objective was 
      to determine whether concentrations of temsirolimus or sirolimus were achieved in 
      brain tumor tissue. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with recurrent malignant 
      gliomas not receiving EIAEDs initially received temsirolimus weekly at a dose of 
      250 mg i.v. The dose was subsequently reduced to 170 mg due to intolerable side 
      effects. For patients taking EIAEDs, the starting dose of temsirolimus was 250 mg 
      with standard dose escalation until the maximal tolerated dose was established. 
      Ten whole blood samples were obtained over a period of 24 h after administration 
      of temsirolimus for pharmacokinetic assessments. Patients eligible for 
      cytoreductive surgery received temsirolimus before tumor resection. Whole blood 
      and tumor tissue were obtained for analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences in 
      the pharmacokinetic variables for temsirolimus and sirolimus were observed 
      between the two patient groups at a comparable dose level of 250 mg. For patients 
      receiving EIAEDs, the systemic exposure to temsirolimus was lower by 1.5-fold. 
      Likewise, peak concentrations and exposure to sirolimus were lower by 2-fold. 
      Measurable concentrations of temsirolimus and sirolimus were observed in brain 
      tumor specimens. The average tissue to whole blood ratio for temsirolimus was 
      1.43 and 0.84 for sirolimus. CONCLUSIONS: Drugs that induce cytochrome P450 3A4, 
      such as EIAEDs, significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus and its 
      active metabolite, sirolimus. Total exposure to temsirolimus and sirolimus was 
      lower in the EIAED group at the maximum tolerated dose of 250 mg compared with 
      the non-EIAED group at the maximum tolerated dose of 170 mg. However, brain tumor 
      tissue concentrations of temsirolimus and sirolimus were relatively comparable in 
      both groups of patients at their respective dose levels. Correlative analyses of 
      the tissue for the inhibition of the key regulators (p70S6 kinase and 4E-binding 
      protein 1) of mammalian target of rapamycin are necessary to define the 
      therapeutic significance of the altered exposure to temsirolimus.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in heart transplant recipients with chronic renal 
      impairment.
PG  - 1547-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: A common clinical problem following organ transplantation is the 
      development of renal failure due to calcineurin inhibitors. Sirolimus offers the 
      potential of providing appropriate immunosuppression without nephrotoxicity. This 
      study evaluates the impact of sirolimus monotherapy on renal function in patients 
      late following heart transplantation and correlates trough sirolimus levels with 
      area-under-the-concentration time curve measurements. METHODS: Six male patients 
      with renal impairment late following heart transplantation (mean 8 years) were 
      offered sirolimus therapy. Calcineurin inhibition was discontinued in all 
      patients on commencing sirolimus. Patients started on sirolimus 2 to 5 mg/d 
      orally. Venous blood samples for pharmacokinetic studies and repeat creatinine 
      clearance were performed before and 6 weeks after commencement of sirolimus in 
      all subjects. RESULTS: Sirolimus trough levels accurately reflected sirolimus 
      area-under-the-concentration time curve measurements. There was no change in 
      renal function. Mean creatinine clearance prior to commencing sirolimus was 26.7 
      (12.2) mL/min and the post-sirolimus creatinine clearance performed 6 weeks later 
      was 23.4 (11.7) mL/min (P = .64). CONCLUSIONS: Trough levels of sirolimus 
      correlate with drug exposure and may be used to monitor sirolimus therapy. No 
      improvement in renal function following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal occurred 
      in this cohort.

TI  - Phase I study of the oral mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus 
      (RAD001) in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
PG  - 563-70
LID - 10.1007/s12185-010-0707-5 [doi]
AB  - Phase I study was conducted to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
      efficacy of the oral mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, everolimus 
      (RAD001), in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 
      Patients received everolimus 5 or 10 mg orally once daily. Dose escalation was 
      based on the safety assessment and the probability of dose-limiting toxicities 
      (DLTs) using a Bayesian logistic model. DLTs were evaluated in six patients at 
      each dose level during the initial 28 days of study treatment. A total of 13 
      patients were enrolled; 5 mg (seven) and 10 mg (six). No DLTs were observed at 
      either dose level. Frequently observed potentially drug-related adverse events 
      included leukopenia (8/13), thrombocytopenia (8/13), elevated hepatic 
      transaminase (9/13), stomatitis (7/13), anemia (6/13), and nasopharyngitis 
      (6/13). All adverse events were reversible. Non-infectious pneumonitis (grade 1) 
      in one patient resolved following discontinuation of everolimus. Two patients 
      with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and two patients with follicular lymphomas 
      achieved objective responses with an overall response rate of 31% (4/13). The 
      pharmacokinetic profiles were not different from those in non-Japanese patients. 
      Everolimus was well tolerated at doses up to 10 mg/day and showed potential 
      efficacy in relapsed or refractory NHL, warranting further investigation.

TI  - The effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in healthy 
      volunteers.
PG  - 51-6
LID - 10.1002/cpdd.40 [doi]
AB  - Sirolimus, metabolized primarily by intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4, is a substrate 
      for P-glycoprotein. CYP3A4 inducers would be expected to decrease sirolimus 
      exposure. This open-label, nonrandomized study investigated effects of CYP3A4 
      induction, by rifampin, on sirolimus pharmacokinetics. Healthy volunteers 
      received sirolimus 20 mg on day 1. After washout period, multiple 600-mg rifampin 
      doses were administered daily for 14 days. On day 9, one 20-mg sirolimus dose was 
      administered after an overnight fast (≥10 hours). Whole blood samples for 
      sirolimus collected for 144 hours after each dose were analyzed by liquid 
      chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters, assessed 
      using noncompartmental methods, were compared using analysis of variance. 
      Geometric mean ratios of Cmax and AUCinf were 29% (90% CI: 26, 32%) and 18% (90% 
      CI: 16, 21%), respectively, with rifampin co-administration versus sirolimus 
      alone. Corresponding decreases in Cmax and AUC were 71% and 82%, respectively, 
      which would likely cause trough concentrations to fall below the recommended 
      therapeutic range. Mean CL/F increased approximately fivefold with rifampin 
      versus sirolimus alone. Co-administering sirolimus and potent CYP3A inducers is 
      not recommended. If co-administration is necessary, dose adjustment and 
      concentration monitoring should be conducted.

TI  - Effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of everolimus: a 
      single-dose, open-label, parallel-group study.
PG  - 215-25
LID - S0149-2918(13)00063-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.02.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the pharmacokinetics of everolimus, an oral mammalian target 
      of rapamycin inhibitor, have been characterized in patients with moderate hepatic 
      impairment, they have not been assessed in those with mild or severe hepatic 
      impairment. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics 
      and safety of everolimus in healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function and 
      patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and 
      severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment in otherwise good health to inform 
      dosing in the clinical setting. METHODS: A multicenter, open-label, Phase I study 
      in which all enrollees received a single, 10-mg, oral everolimus dose was 
      conducted. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessment were collected at 
      predetermined time points up to 168 hours postdosing. Safety was also assessed. 
      Proposed dose recommendations based on Child-Pugh status at baseline and day 8 
      were calculated based on AUC0-∞ geometric mean ratios and their associated 90% 
      CIs. Post hoc analysis of the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and 
      markers of hepatic function was also performed to identify thresholds for dose 
      adjustment. RESULTS: Thirteen subjects with normal hepatic function and 7 
      patients with mild, 8 patients with moderate, and 6 patients with severe hepatic 
      impairment were enrolled. Compared with normal subjects, everolimus AUC0-∞ for 
      patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment increased by 1.60-, 
      3.26-, and 3.64-fold, respectively. Based on Child-Pugh classification at day 8, 
      the everolimus doses required to adjust the exposure of patients with mild, 
      moderate, and severe hepatic impairment to that of normal subjects were 6.25, 
      3.07, and 2.75 mg, respectively. Thresholds for 2-fold everolimus dose reduction 
      were 15.0 μmol/L for bilirubin, 43.1 g/L for albumin, and 1.1 for the 
      international normalized ratio; using these thresholds could lead to underdosing 
      or overdosing in some patients. Most adverse events were of grade 1 severity, ≤1 
      day in duration, and not everolimus related. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus exposure 
      after a single 10-mg dose was influenced by the degree of hepatic impairment. 
      Child-Pugh classification was found to be the most conservative means of guiding 
      dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment. Based on these data, as well 
      as previously reported data for patients with moderate hepatic impairment, 
      everolimus once-daily dosing should be 7.5 mg and 5 mg in patients with mild and 
      moderate impairment, respectively. Everolimus is not recommended in patients with 
      severe hepatic impairment unless benefits outweigh risks; in that case, 2.5 mg 
      once daily should not be exceeded. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00968591.

TI  - A phase 1 study of oral ridaforolimus in pediatric patients with advanced solid 
      tumors.
PG  - 84736-84747
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.12450 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ridaforolimus is an investigational, potent, selective mTOR inhibitor. 
      This study was conducted to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), 
      maximum tolerated dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of oral 
      ridaforolimus in children with advanced solid tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In 
      this phase 1, multicenter, open-label study in children aged 6 to <18 years with 
      advanced solid tumors, ridaforolimus was administered orally for 5 consecutive 
      days/week in 28-day cycles until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent 
      withdrawal. Dose started at 22 mg/m2 and increased to 28 mg/m2 and 33 mg/m2, 
      followed by expansion at the RP2D. RESULTS: Twenty patients were treated; 18 were 
      evaluable for dose-limiting toxicities. One dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 
      increased alanine aminotransferase) occurred in 1 patient at 33 mg/m2. Dose 
      escalation concluded at 33 mg/m2; the maximum tolerated dose was not determined. 
      The most common treatment-related adverse events (frequency ≥40%) were manageable 
      grade 1-2 stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, increased alanine 
      aminotransferase, fatigue, hypercholesterolemia, anemia, and increased aspartate 
      aminotransferase. Ridaforolimus exposure at 28 mg/m2 and 33 mg/m2 exceeded adult 
      target levels. The RP2D for oral ridaforolimus in children was defined as 33 
      mg/m2. Four patients received at least 4 cycles; 2 with pineoblastoma and diffuse 
      intrinsic pontine glioma had stable disease for 12 and 46 cycles, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Ridaforolimus is orally bioavailable and well tolerated in children 
      with advanced solid tumors. The RP2D (33 mg/m2, 5 days/week) exceeds the adult 
      RP2D. The favorable toxicity and pharmacokinetic profiles may allow for 
      combination therapy, a promising therapeutic option in pediatric malignancies.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in pediatric patients with 
      neurofibromatosis type 1.
PG  - 332-7
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0b013e318286dd3f [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The narrow therapeutic index and large interpatient variability in 
      sirolimus pharmacokinetics (PK) make therapeutic drug monitoring necessary. 
      Factors responsible for PK variability are not well understood, and published PK 
      studies do not include pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). 
      The objectives of this study were to estimate sirolimus clearance in a cohort of 
      children with NF1 using data collected in a concentration-guided trial, to 
      evaluate the effect of treatment duration on clearance and dose requirements, and 
      to evaluate the association of sirolimus clearance with patient-specific factors, 
      including age, weight, body surface area (BSA), race, and sex. METHODS: Sirolimus 
      concentration-time data were collected from an ongoing prospective trial in 
      children with NF1. An iterative 2-stage Bayesian method was used for the PK 
      parameter analyses. RESULTS: Data from 44 patients with NF1 were included in the 
      analyses. Mean age was 8.4 years (SD 4.5, range 3-18), and mean weight was 29.8 
      kg (SD 16.7, range 12-85.8). Mean sirolimus clearance was 11.8 L/h (SD 4.6, range 
      2.2-24.1), and the mean dose to obtain a target trough concentration of 10-15 
      ng/mL was 2.0 mg/m administered twice daily (SD 0.72, range 0.77-3.85). A 
      nonlinear relationship between age and clearance was observed. Total body weight 
      and BSA were strong predictors of sirolimus clearance (r = 0.67 and 0.65, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus clearance in children with NF1 is 
      comparable with that in pediatric transplant patients. Clearance was most 
      associated with body size parameters (BSA and total body weight) in children with 
      NF1. When normalized for size, an age effect on clearance was observed in the 
      youngest patients, most likely because of the maturational changes in drug 
      absorption and metabolism. A mean dose of 2.0 mg/m twice a day was required for 
      attainment of target trough concentrations of 10-15 ng/mL in children greater 
      than 3 years of age who have NF1. The updated model will allow PK-guided 
      individualized dosing of sirolimus in patients with NF1.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in pediatric patients with kaposiform 
      hemangioendothelioma: A retrospective study.
PG  - 2412-2419
LID - 10.3892/ol.2019.10562 [doi]
AB  - Numerous studies have established population pharmacokinetics (PPK) models of 
      sirolimus in various populations. However, a PPK model of sirolimus in Chinese 
      patients with pediatric kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (PKHE) has yet to be 
      established; therefore, this was the purpose of the present study. The present 
      study was a retrospective analysis that utilized the trough concentration data 
      obtained from traditional therapeutic drug monitoring-based dose adjustments. A 
      total of 17 Chinese patients with PKHE from a real-world study were characterized 
      by non-linear mixed-effects modeling. The impact of demographic features, 
      biological characteristics and concomitant medications was assessed. The 
      developed final model was evaluated via bootstrap and a prediction-corrected 
      visual predictive check. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and 
      elimination was used for modeling of data for PKHE. The typical values of 
      apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) in the 
      final model were 3.19 l/h and 165 liters, respectively. Age, alanine transaminase 
      levels and sex were included as significant covariates for CL/F, while the 
      duration of treatment with sirolimus was a significant covariate for V/F. In 
      conclusion, the present study developed and validated the first sirolimus PPK 
      model for Chinese patients with PKHE.

TI  - The minimal impact of food on the pharmacokinetics of ridaforolimus.
PG  - 177-82
LID - 10.1007/s00280-012-1897-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ridaforolimus, a potent inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin 
      (mTOR), is under development for the treatment for solid tumors. This open-label, 
      randomized, 3-period crossover study investigated the effect of food on the 
      pharmacokinetics of ridaforolimus 40 mg as well as safety and tolerability of the 
      study medication. METHODS: Ridaforolimus was administered to 18 healthy, male 
      subjects (mean age 36.4 years) in the fasted state, following ingestion of a 
      light breakfast, and following a high-fat breakfast. Whole blood samples were 
      collected from each subject pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 
      168 h post-dose. RESULTS: The geometric mean (95 % confidence interval, CI) 
      fasted blood area under the curve (AUC(0-∞)) and maximum concentration (C(max)) 
      were 1940 (1510, 2500) ng h/mL and 116 (87, 156) ng/mL, respectively, and median 
      time to C(max) (T(max)) and average apparent terminal half-life (t(1/2)) were 6.0 
      and 64.5 h, respectively. Both T(max) and t(1/2) were similar in the fasted and 
      fed states. With a light breakfast, the geometric mean intra-individual ratios 
      (GMRs) for AUC(0-∞) and C(max) (fed/fasted) and 90 % CIs were 1.06 (0.85, 1.32) 
      and 1.15 (0.83, 1.60); following a high-fat breakfast, the AUC(0-∞) and C(max) 
      GMRs (90 % CI) were 1.46 (1.18, 1.81) and 1.12 (0.81, 1.53), respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Increases in ridaforolimus exposure following both the light and 
      high-fat breakfasts were not considered to be clinically meaningful. 
      Ridaforolimus was generally well tolerated, and there were no discontinuations 
      due to drug-related AEs. Ridaforolimus should be given without regard to food.

TI  - A phase I multiple-dose escalation study characterizing pharmacokinetics and 
      safety of ABT-578 in healthy subjects.
PG  - 910-8
AB  - ABT-578, a sirolimus analog, is being developed for administration from 
      drug-eluting stents to prevent postimplantation neointimal hyperplasia. The 
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
      pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of ABT-578. Healthy subjects randomly received 
      placebo or ABT-578 (200, 400, or 800 microg) as daily intravenous infusions for 
      14 days. ABT-578 blood pharmacokinetics and urine excretion on days 1 and 14 were 
      determined. The effect of ABT-578 on mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation 
      was assessed. ABT-578 pharmacokinetics was described by a 3-compartment open 
      model. The mean CL, V(ss), and t(1/2) ranges were 4.0 to 4.6 L/h, 92.5 to 118.0 
      L, and 24.7 to 31.0 hours, respectively. ABT-578 pharmacokinetics was dose and 
      time invariant. Approximately 0.1% of ABT-578 was excreted in the urine. ABT-578 
      was well tolerated, and no systemic changes were observed in the 
      mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. ABT-578 was shown to be safe over a 
      wide range of systemic exposures.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of everolimus when combined with cyclosporine in Japanese de

LID - S0041-1345(14)00127-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2014.01.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, there are no published data on pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      everolimus in combination with cyclosporine in Japanese renal transplant 
      patients. We evaluated the PK of everolimus in Japanese de novo renal transplant 
      patients who received everolimus in combination with cyclosporine. METHODS: In 
      this phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label study, patients were randomized 
      (1:1) to 1 of the 2 groups: everolimus 1.5 mg (targeted C0 of 3-8 ng/mL) plus 
      reduced-dose cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/d plus standard-dose 
      cyclosporine. PK assessments for everolimus were performed on day 28 (month 1) in 
      the PK subpopulation. RESULTS: A total of 11 patients (7 men), mean age 47.5 ± 
      11.21 years, were enrolled for PK analysis of everolimus. Starting at 1.5 mg 
      (0.75 mg twice a day), the mean dose over a period of 28 days was 0.705 ± 0.1011 
      mg. Everolimus mean trough concentration was 4.307 ± 1.2459 ng/mL and mean peak 
      concentration was 13.539 ± 3.5330 ng/mL, which peaked at 1 to 2 hours postdose. 
      The average concentration was 7.558 ± 1.4723 ng/mL, area under the 
      concentration-time curve was 90.70 ± 17.667 ng·h/mL, and peak-trough fluctuation 
      was 122.6%. The PK parameters of everolimus were comparable to those in the 
      earlier phase 3 studies (A2306 and A2307). The mean everolimus trough levels were 
      within the target ranges at all time points ranging from 3.4 to 5.5 ng/mL 
      (everolimus 0.75 mg twice a day, safety population). The majority of patients 
      (>85% from day 7 onward) were maintained within the targeted everolimus trough 
      blood levels (safety population). These data were similar to a non-Japanese study 
      (A2309). CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetic characteristics of everolimus in 
      Japanese de novo renal transplant patients did not differ from those previously 
      observed in non-Japanese patients, hence the same dosage of everolimus may be 
      acceptable in Japanese patients.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic profile of temsirolimus with concomitant administration of 
      cytochrome p450-inducing medications.
PG  - 1430-9
AB  - Temsirolimus is a novel inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, with 
      antitumor activity in advanced tumors. Because temsirolimus and its metabolite, 
      sirolimus, are cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 substrates, the potential exists for 
      interaction with drugs that induce CYP3A activity, including enzyme inducers and 
      rifampin. Cancer patients received once-weekly intravenous (IV) 220 mg/m(2) 
      temsirolimus with or without enzyme inducers. Coadministration with enzyme 
      inducers decreased temsirolimus maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) by 36% and 
      increased volume of distribution by 99%. Sirolimus C(max) and area under the 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) were decreased by 67% and 43%, respectively. In 
      healthy adult subjects, coadministration of 25-mg intravenous temsirolimus with 
      rifampin had no significant effect on temsirolimus C(max) and AUC but decreased 
      sirolimus C(max) and AUC by 65% and 56%, respectively. Rifampin decreased 
      AUC(sum) by 41%. Temsirolimus was well tolerated in both studies. If concomitant 
      agents with CYP3A induction potential are used, higher temsirolimus doses may be 
      needed to achieve adequate tumor tissue drug levels.

TI  - CYP3A5 genotype markedly influences the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus and 
      sirolimus in kidney transplant recipients.
PG  - 228-34
AB  - It is currently not clear whether the concentration-time curves of the 
      immunosuppressants differ with respect to the CYP3A5, MDR1, or MRP2 genotype in 
      dose-adapted stable kidney transplant patients. Dose/trough concentration ratios 
      were obtained in 134 tacrolimus and 20 sirolimus-treated patients, and plasma 
      concentration-time profiles were obtained from 16 (tacrolimus) and 10 (sirolimus) 
      patients. Genotyping was carried out for CYP3A5 6986A>G; ABCB1 2677G>T/A, 3435C>T 
      and ABCC2 -24C>T; 1249G>A; 3972C>T. Dose/trough concentration ratios were 
      0.67+/-0.3 and 1.36+/-0.73 x 10(3) l (P<0.00001) for tacrolimus and 0.42+/-0.17 
      and 0.84+/-0.46 x 10(3) l (P=0.18) for sirolimus in CYP3A5 non-expressors and 
      expressors. The unadjusted tacrolimus area under curve (AUC)(0-12) was 
      106.8+/-17.5 ng/ml x h compared with 133.3+/-42.2 ng/ml x h (P=0.37) without 
      affecting serum creatinine. Mean unadjusted AUC(0-24) of sirolimus did not differ 
      significantly either. Therefore, CYP3A5 expressor status and not transporter 
      variants is a main determinant of oral clearance, particularly for tacrolimus. 
      Dose adaptation according to trough levels, however, appears to be sufficient to 
      maintain similar concentration-time profiles.

TI  - Clinical development of an everolimus pediatric formulation: relative 
      bioavailability, food effect, and steady-state pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 141-7
AB  - The immunosuppressant everolimus used in organ transplantation is formulated as a 
      conventional tablet for adults and a dispersible tablet that can be administered 
      in water for pediatric use. As part of the pediatric clinical development 
      program, the relative bioavailability and food effect for the dispersible tablet 
      were evaluated in healthy adult subjects as a prelude to characterizing the 
      steady-state pharmacokinetics in pediatric kidney allograft recipients. In a 
      randomized, open-label, three-way crossover study, 24 healthy adults received 
      single 1.5-mg oral doses of everolimus as (1) six 0.25-mg dispersible tablets in 
      water, (2) two 0.75-mg conventional tablets, and (3) six 0.25-mg dispersible 
      tablets in water after a high-fat breakfast. Cmax and AUC were evaluated by 
      standard bioequivalence testing to determine relative bioavailability and to 
      quantify the effect of food. In a multicenter open-label efficacy/safety trial, 
      pediatric renal allograft recipients received 0.8 mg/m2 (maximum 1.5 mg) bid 
      everolimus as dispersible tablets in water. Serial trough concentrations over the 
      first week and a steady-state pharmacokinetic profile on day 7 posttransplant 
      were collected in 19 patients ranging from ages 2 to 16 years old. The 
      bioavailability of everolimus from the dispersible tablet was 10% lower relative 
      to the conventional tablet, with a ratio (90% confidence interval) of 0.90 
      (0.76-1.07). After a high-fat meal, tmax was delayed by a median 2.5 hours, and 
      Cmax was reduced by 50%. Overall absorption, however, was not affected by food 
      inasmuch as the fed/fasting AUC ratio was 0.99 (0.83-1.17). In pediatric 
      patients, steady state was reached between days 3 and 5. The corresponding 
      steady-state parameters were as follows: Cmin, 4.4 +/- 1.7 ng/ml; Cmax, 13.6 +/- 
      4.2 ng/ml; and AUC, 87 +/- 27 ng.h/ml. Steady-state concentration-time profiles 
      in pediatric transplant patients receiving the dispersible tablet were comparable 
      to those of adult patients receiving the conventional tablet when both were dosed 
      to yield similar trough concentrations. If a pediatric patient is converted from 
      the everolimus dispersible tablet to the conventional tablet, this should be 
      based on a 1:1 milligram switch with subsequent therapeutic drug monitoring to 
      further individualize the dose as needed. The dispersible tablet formulation 
      should be taken consistently either with or without food to minimize fluctuations 
      in exposure over time.

TI  - A Semi-Physiological Population Model to Quantify the Effect of Hematocrit on 
      Everolimus Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in Cancer Patients.
PG  - 1447-1456
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Everolimus (a drug from the class of mammalian target 
      of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors) is associated with frequent toxicity-related dose 
      reductions. Everolimus accumulates in erythrocytes, but the extent to which 
      hematocrit affects everolimus plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is 
      unknown. We aimed to investigate the everolimus pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics 
      and the influence of hematocrit in cancer patients. METHODS: A semi-physiological 
      pharmacokinetic model for everolimus was developed from pharmacokinetic data from 
      73 patients by non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Using a simulation study with a 
      known pharmacodynamic model describing S6K1 (a downstream mTOR effector) 
      inhibition, we investigated the impact of hematocrit. RESULTS: The apparent 
      volume of distribution of the central and peripheral compartment were estimated 
      to be 207 L with a relative standard error (RSE) of 5.0 % and 485 L (RSE 4.2 %), 
      respectively, with an inter-compartmental clearance of 72.1 L/h (RSE 3.2 %). The 
      apparent intrinsic clearance was 198 L/h (RSE 4.3 %). A decrease in hematocrit 
      from 45 % to 20 % resulted in a predicted reduction in whole-blood exposure of 
      ~50 %, but everolimus plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were not 
      affected. The predicted S6K1 inhibition was at a plateau level in the approved 
      dose of 10 mg once daily. CONCLUSIONS: A population pharmacokinetic model was 
      developed for everolimus in cancer patients. Hematocrit influenced whole-blood 
      pharmacokinetics, but not plasma pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Everolimus 
      whole-blood concentrations should always be corrected for hematocrit. Since 
      predicted mTOR inhibition was at a plateau level in the approved dose, dose 
      reductions may have only a limited impact on mTOR inhibition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperlipidemia occurs in up to 50% of kidney transplant (KT) 
      recipients who take everolimus (EVL). As a result of this, statins are the most 
      commonly prescribed lipid-lowering drugs among these patients. However, we are 
      concerned whether there are any drug interactions between EVL and statins, 
      because both of these drugs use the same pharmacokinetics pathway. Therefore, we 
      assessed the effects of concomitant use of EVL and atorvastatin. METHODS: In this 
      randomized, open-label, crossover study, 20 KT patients were assigned (1:1) to 
      receive EVL with or without 20 mg atorvastatin for 1 month. One-month washout 
      period was used before crossover. Plasma EVL concentrations were measured by 
      homogeneous particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay. Twelve-hour area under 
      the time-concentration curve (AUC0-12) of EVL was calculated with the use of 
      whole-blood EVL concentrations from 10 different time points (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 
      2.5, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours). RESULTS: The mean (SD) AUC0-12 for EVL and EVL plus 
      atorvastatin was 155.9 (41.6) ng·h/mL and 151.3 (51.4) ng·h/mL, respectively (P > 
      .05; paired t test). No difference of EVL Cmax or Tmax was found after 
      atorvastatin coadministration. Even though the EVL AUC0-12 levels were not 
      affected by atorvastatin coadministration in one-half of the subjects, for the 
      rest of the patients, there were unpredictable changes in the EVL AUC0-12 levels. 
      This may be due to the high intrapatient variability of EVL drug concentration 
      (coefficient of variation ranges from 9.8% to 34.1%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Coadministration of atorvastatin with EVL in KT recipients did not affect the 
      pharmacokinetics of EVL.

TI  - Disposition of everolimus in mdr1a-/1b- mice and after a pre-treatment of 
      lapatinib in Swiss mice.
PG  - 1629-34
LID - 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.02.013 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to document the in vivo transport of everolimus 
      (inhibitor of mTOR) by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and to investigate the influence of 
      lapatinib (inhibitor of P-gp) on everolimus disposition. Pharmacokinetics of 
      everolimus (0.25mg/kg) has been investigated after oral administration in 
      mdr1a-/1b- mice compared to the wild type. Also, everolimus pharmacokinetics was 
      characterized after oral administration on Swiss mice either alone or after 2 
      days of pre-treatment of lapatinib (200mg/kg). The influence of lapatinib 
      pre-treatment on intestinal P-gp expression was investigated by Western blot 
      analysis. The non-compartimental analysis was performed using Winonlin 
      professional version 4.1 software (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA). The areas under 
      the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were compared using Bailer's method. A 
      significant 1.3-fold increase of everolimus AUC observed in mdr1a-/1b- mice 
      suggested that everolimus is transported in vivo by intestinal P-gp in mice. In 
      addition, a 2.6-fold significant increase of everolimus AUC with lapatinib 
      pre-treatment as compared with the everolimus alone group was noticed. The 
      elimination half-life was comparable (t(1/2)=5.3h vs. t(1/2)=4h). A 38.5% 
      significant decrease of P-gp expression was observed in duodenum segment in 
      lapatinib pre-treated group as compared with control group. In conclusion, 
      lapatinib enhanced everolimus absorption by decreasing intestinal P-gp 
      expression. An inhibition of CYP 450 could not be excluded. These results confirm 
      the necessity of a therapeutic monitoring of everolimus combined with an 
      inhibitor of the P-gp and CYP 450 like lapatinib in a future anti-tumor 
      treatment.

TI  - No clinically significant drug interactions between lenalidomide and 
      P‑glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors: results from controlled phase I studies 
      in healthy volunteers.
PG  - 1031-9
LID - 10.1007/s00280-014-2438-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Lenalidomide, a weak substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro, is an 
      oral anticancer drug eliminated predominantly via renal excretion as unchanged 
      compound. The role of P-gp in lenalidomide disposition and the associated 
      clinical relevance were evaluated. METHODS: Two phase I, crossover studies were 
      conducted in healthy volunteers. In Study 1, subjects received lenalidomide (10 
      mg × 7 days) alone or with the P-gp substrate digoxin (0.5 mg on Day 5). In Study 
      2, subjects received lenalidomide (a single 25 mg dose) alone, the P-gp inhibitor 
      quinidine (300-600 mg twice-daily × 5 days) plus lenalidomide (on Day 4), the 
      P-gp inhibitor/substrate temsirolimus (a single 25 mg dose) alone, or 
      lenalidomide plus temsirolimus. Pharmacokinetic and safety data were collected 
      for lenalidomide and the co-administrated drugs. RESULTS: There were no 
      significant changes in the maximum concentration (C max) and area under the 
      plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of lenalidomide when co-administered with 
      quinidine, digoxin, or temsirolimus. Neither the rate nor the capacity of 
      lenalidomide renal excretion was affected by quinidine or temsirolimus, in 
      addition lenalidomide absorption rate and bioavailability remained unchanged. 
      Furthermore, lenalidomide had no significant effect on blood C max and AUC of 
      temsirolimus and its active metabolite sirolimus (also a P-gp 
      inhibitor/substrate). The C max of digoxin was slightly higher (+14 %) when 
      administered with lenalidomide versus placebo. There were no other changes in 
      digoxin pharmacokinetics upon co-administration with lenalidomide. No remarkable 
      safety findings were observed. CONCLUSIONS: There are no clinically significant 
      pharmacokinetic interactions between lenalidomide and substrates or inhibitors of 
      P-gp.

TI  - Effects of the pharmacokinetic interaction between orally administered sirolimus 
      and cyclosporine on the synergistic prolongation of heart allograft survival in 
      rats.
PG  - 986-94
AB  - Oral administration, but not continuous intravenous infusion, of sirolimus (SRL) 
      in combination with cyclosporine (CsA) produces a pharmacokinetic interaction, 
      namely increases in the whole blood trough concentrations of SRL ([SRL(WB)]) and 
      CsA ([CsA(WB)]). The effects of this pharmacokinetic interaction on the synergism 
      between SRL and CsA was examined in Wistar Furth (RT1u) recipients of Buffalo 
      (RT1b) heart allografts. A 14-day course of oral SRL produced dose-dependent 
      prolongation of heart allografts: in untreated controls, 0.5 mg/kg SRL per day 
      extended the mean survival time (MST) from 6.4+/-0.5 days to 12.3+/-3.8 days 
      (P<0.05); SRL at 1.0 mg/kg per day prolonged the MST to 18.0+/-5.5 days (P<0.01); 
      at 2.0 mg/kg SRL per day, MST was extended to 52.5+/-13.2 days (P<0.01); and 4.0 
      mg/kg SRL per day prolonged MST to 90.0+/-41.1 days (P<0.01). Comparison of the 
      in vivo effects after oral versus continuous intravenous SRL administration 
      suggested that the oral bioavailability of SRL is less than 10%. Combinations of 
      oral SRL and CsA synergistically prolonged heart allograft survival, as 
      documented by combination index values of 0.01-0.64 (combination index <1 
      indicates synergistic interaction). In rats treated with dual drug combinations, 
      CsA increased the bioavailability of SRL by two- to elevenfold, and SRL increased 
      the bioavailability of CsA by two- to threefold, thereby significantly decreasing 
      the oral effective dose (ED) values for each drug. The ED50 for SRL alone is 2.4 
      mg/kg per day, which produces an average [SRL(WB)] of 13.2 ng/ml. The ED50 for 
      CsA alone is 8.0 mg/kg per day, which produces an average [CsA(WB)] of 1642 
      ng/ml. However, when the two drugs are combined, the ED50 effect is achieved with 
      only 0.34 mg/kg SRL per day ([SRL(WB)]=1.1 ng/ml) and 2.1 mg/kg CsA per day 
      ([CsA(WB)] =326 ng/ml). Individually, 0.34 mg/kg SRL per day produces an ED9 with 
      an average [SRL(WB)] of 0.6 ng/ml, and 2.1 mg/kg CsA per day produces an ED22 
      with an average [CsA(WB)] of 174 ng/ml. Thus, the pharmacokinetic interaction 
      between oral SRL and CsA contributes to the in vivo synergism between the two 
      drugs.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil in combination 
      with sirolimus or ciclosporin in renal transplant patients.
PG  - 758-71
AB  - AIMS: To compare the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid (MPA) and its 
      metabolite (MPAG) when mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is administered in combination 
      with sirolimus or ciclosporin (CsA) in renal allograft recipients. Safety and 
      efficacy (biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR)) were also assessed. METHODS: 
      Patients (n = 45) were randomized 2 : 1 to receive treatment with sirolimus (n = 
      30; dosed to maintain trough concentrations of 10-25 ng ml(-1) until week 8, and 
      then 8-15 ng ml(-1) thereafter) or CsA (n = 15; administered as per centre 
      practice) both in combination with daclizumab, oral MMF and corticosteroids. 
      Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed at day 7, week 4, and months 3 and 6 
      post-transplant. The primary endpoint was the AUC(0,12 h) for MPA and MPAG. The 
      pharmacokinetics of sirolimus were also assessed. RESULTS: MPA exposure was 
      39-50% lower (month 6 mean AUC(0,12 h) (95%CI): 40.4 (33.8, 47.0) vs. 68.5 (54.9, 
      82.0) microg ml(-1) h) and MPAG exposure was 25-52% higher (722 (607, 838) vs. 
      485 (402, 569) microg ml(-1) h at month 6) in the presence of CsA compared with 
      sirolimus across visits. BPAR was 40.0% with sirolimus and 13.3% with CsA. The 
      incidence of hypertension, tremors and hirsutism was higher with CsA than with 
      sirolimus, while the incidence of diarrhoea, hyperlipidaemia and impaired wound 
      closure was higher with sirolimus. No deaths, malignancies or graft losses were 
      reported. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of sirolimus with MMF led to greater MPA 
      exposure, but lower MPAG exposure, than co-administration with CsA. As rejection 
      rates were higher in the absence of CsA, further study of calcineurin 
      inhibitor-free regimens is required before general recommendations can be made.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetics of Everolimus in Relation to Clinical Outcomes in 
      Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.
PG  - 663-669
AB  - BACKGROUND: Everolimus has been used for the treatment of unresectable or 
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here, we measured blood concentrations of 
      everolimus to obtain the population pharmacokinetic parameters and to examine the 
      relationship between blood concentration and clinical outcomes. METHODS: 
      Twenty-two Japanese patients were enrolled. Blood samples were collected before 
      and 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after drug administration on days 1 and 8 of everolimus 
      therapy (5 or 10 mg) from inpatients; occasional samples were collected from 
      outpatients. Blood concentrations of everolimus were measured by high-performance 
      liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Population pharmacokinetic 
      analysis was conducted using the NONMEM software. RESULTS: Everolimus 
      pharmacokinetics was best described by a 2-compartment model with population mean 
      estimates of apparent oral clearance of 10.0 L/h and an interindividual 
      variability of 42.4%. There was no relationship between overall best responses 
      and the predicted trough concentrations at day 8. The predicted trough 
      concentration in patients who terminated everolimus treatment owing to adverse 
      drug reactions (ADRs) was significantly higher than in patients who stopped the 
      treatment owing to disease progression or other reasons (27.6 ± 3.1 versus 15.7 ± 
      2.3 ng/mL; mean ± SEM). Patients who terminated the treatment owing to ADRs had 
      significantly shorter time-to-treatment failure than other patients (112 versus 
      187 days, median). CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the first population 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of everolimus in patients with RCC. Individual dose 
      adjustment based on everolimus blood concentrations helps to avoid early drug 
      cessation due to ADRs.

AB  - Information about the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of target of 
      rapamycin (TOR) inhibitors, such as sirolimus and everolimus, in pediatric renal 
      transplant recipients is limited. In an ascending single-dose pharmacokinetic 
      study of sirolimus in pediatric dialysis patients, no clinically significant 
      association was observed between patient age and absorption of sirolimus from the 
      gastrointestinal tract. However, young pediatric patients (5 to 11 years of age) 
      exhibited significantly greater apparent oral clearances, suggesting that 
      pediatric patients require slightly higher doses than do adults when adjusted for 
      body weight or surface area. Similarly, in studies performed in pediatric renal 
      transplant recipients, the half-life of sirolimus was shorter and the clearance 
      was greater in younger patients. On the other hand, in single-dose 
      pharmacokinetic studies of everolimus, the apparent clearance was reduced in 
      pediatric renal transplant recipients compared with clearance in adults. This 
      reduced clearance was attributed to a smaller apparent volume of distribution in 
      pediatric patients, rather than to a difference in terminal half-life. This 
      suggested that, although the adult 12-hour dosing interval was appropriate for 
      pediatric patients, they would require reduced dosing based on body size compared 
      with adults. In a large trial (N = 719) of sirolimus versus azathioprine in 
      combination with cyclosporine microemulsion and prednisone, 6 pediatric patients 
      (13 to 18 years of age) received sirolimus at 2 mg/d, 3 received sirolimus at 5 
      mg/d, and 3 received azathioprine. Seven of the nine patients who received 
      sirolimus experienced no rejection episodes. Six infectious episodes occurred in 
      the 6 patients receiving sirolimus at 2 mg/d, 10 episodes occurred in the 3 
      patients receiving sirolimus at 5 mg/d, and 8 episodes occurred in the 3 patients 
      receiving azathioprine. At 6 months after transplantation, renal function was 
      similar in all 3 groups, although there was a statistically nonsignificant 
      increase in the group receiving sirolimus at 5 mg/d. The mean cholesterol and 
      triglyceride levels were generally comparable in all 3 groups. TOR inhibitors are 
      promising agents for the prevention of graft rejection in pediatric renal 
      transplant recipients, but more pharmacokinetic data are required to assess the 
      optimal dosing regimens in this population. In addition, further data are needed 
      on the efficacy and safety of TOR inhibitors in combination with other agents in 
      pediatric transplantation recipients to best assess the role of TOR inhibition in 
      corticosteroid and/or calcineurin inhibitor-sparing regimens.

TI  - A Phase 1 clinical study of temsirolimus (CCI-779) in Japanese patients with 
      advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 732-8
LID - 10.1093/jjco/hyq047 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Temsirolimus (CCI-779) is a novel inhibitor of the mammalian target of 
      rapamycin. This Phase 1 study was aimed at investigating the maximum-tolerated 
      dose, toxicity, pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity in Japanese patients with 
      advanced solid tumors. METHODS: Temsirolimus was given as a 30 min intravenous 
      infusion once a week. Patients with solid tumors not amenable to standard forms 
      of treatment were eligible. Dose escalation of temsirolimus was planned from 15, 
      45, 80 to 165 mg/m(2). The pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus and sirolimus in 
      whole blood were examined for cycles 1, 2, 4 and 5 of treatment. RESULTS: Ten 
      patients (median age 60.5 years; range 41-69 years) with advanced solid tumors 
      were enrolled. Their primary cancers were renal cell carcinoma (five patients), 
      lung cancer (three patients) and colorectal cancer (two patients). The major 
      toxicities were hypophosphatemia diarrhea, hyperglycemia, stomatitis, pyrexia, 
      elevated aspartate aminotransferase, rash, reduced neutrophil count, elevated 
      alanine aminotransferase, anorexia, hypertriglyceridemia and somnolence. Two of 
      three patients who received temsirolimus 45 mg/m(2) developed dose-limiting 
      toxicities of Grade 3 stomatitis (one patient) and Grade 3 diarrhea (two 
      patients). The maximum-tolerated dose was 15 mg/m(2). The peak blood 
      concentrations of temsirolimus and sirolimus, a major active metabolite, 
      increased in a dose-dependent manner. The area under the 
      concentration-versus-time curve of sirolimus, but not temsirolimus, increased in 
      a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended dose for Phase 2 clinical 
      studies of temsirolimus in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors is 15 
      mg/m(2) intravenously once a week.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic drug interaction between AEE788 and RAD001 causing 
      thrombocytopenia in patients with glioblastoma.
PG  - 281-7
LID - 10.1007/s00280-011-1754-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Treating glioblastoma through the simultaneous inhibition of multiple 
      transduction pathways may prove more effective than single-pathway inhibition. We 
      evaluated the safety, biologic activity, and pharmacokinetic profile of oral 
      AEE788, a selective inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and 
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), plus oral RAD001, a mammalian target 
      of rapamycin inhibitor, in glioblastoma patients. METHODS: This phase IB/II, 
      open-label, multicenter, 2-arm, dose-escalation study enrolled adult glioblastoma 
      patients at first or second recurrence/relapse. Primary objective was to 
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of 
      AEE788 combined with RAD001. Secondary objectives included determining the 
      safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity 
      of the combination. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were enrolled (AEE788 200 mg/day + 
      RAD001 5 mg/day, 2 patients; AEE788 150 mg/day + RAD001 5 mg every other day 
      [qod], 14); all patients discontinued the study most commonly because of disease 
      progression. Four patients experienced DLT (AEE788 200 mg/day + RAD001 5 mg/day, 
      1 patient; AEE788 150 mg/day + RAD001 5 mg qod, 3). Both patients receiving 
      AEE788 (200 mg/day) plus RAD001 (5 mg/day) experienced clinically significant 
      thrombocytopenia requiring a dose reduction/interruption. AEE788 appeared to 
      inhibit the metabolism of RAD001. The study was terminated prematurely before an 
      MTD was determined because of safety findings in other studies evaluating AEE788 
      monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The coadministration of AEE788 and RAD001 in 
      glioblastoma patients caused a clinically significant thrombocytopenia and a 
      higher-than-expected RAD001 area under the curve concentration when dosed at 200 
      and 5 mg/day, respectively. After a dose reduction to AEE788 (150 mg/day) and 
      RAD001 (5 mg qod), the combination appeared to be better tolerated.

TI  - Phase Ib study of tivozanib (AV-951) in combination with temsirolimus in patients 
      with renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 2841-50
LID - S0959-8049(13)00353-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejca.2013.04.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tivozanib is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of 
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, -2 and -3, with a long 
      half-life. Tivozanib has demonstrated clinical activity and acceptable 
      tolerability in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This phase Ib study determined the 
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and evaluated the safety and clinical activity 
      of tivozanib plus temsirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced RCC were administered open-label 
      tivozanib 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5mg/d orally (3 weeks on/1 week off) and temsirolimus 15 
      or 25 mg/week intravenously in a 3+3 dose-escalation design and subsequent 
      expansion cohort. RESULTS: Of 27 patients treated, 20 patients had received ≥ 1 
      prior VEGF-targeted therapy. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred; the RP2D was 
      determined to be tivozanib 1.5mg/d plus temsirolimus 25mg/week. Combination of 
      tivozanib plus temsirolimus demonstrated acceptable tolerability and suggested no 
      synergistic toxicity. The most common grade ≤ 3 adverse events were fatigue and 
      thrombocytopenia (15% each). One patient each required dose reduction of 
      tivozanib or temsirolimus due to an adverse event. Confirmed partial responses 
      and stable disease were achieved at 23% and 68%, respectively. Pharmacokinetic 
      analyses may suggest lack of an interaction between tivozanib and temsirolimus. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this small phase Ib study, tivozanib and temsirolimus were safely 
      combined at the fully recommended dose and schedule of both agents. The observed 
      clinical activity and manageable toxicity profile of this combination warrant 
      further exploration in patients with RCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This phase Ib trial investigated the safety, tolerability, and 
      recommended phase II dose and schedule of the MEK inhibitor trametinib in 
      combination with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus. 
      Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetic (PK) characterization and 
      evaluation of clinical activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 67 patients 
      with advanced solid tumors were enrolled in this open-label, single-arm, 
      dose-escalation study. Dose escalation followed a 3 + 3 design. Patients were 
      assigned to one of 10 different cohorts, involving either daily dosing with both 
      agents or daily dosing with trametinib and intermittent everolimus dosing. This 
      included an expansion cohort comprising patients with pancreatic tumors. PKs 
      samples were collected predose, as well as 1, 2, 4, and 6 h post-dose on day 15 
      of the first treatment cycle. RESULTS: Concurrent treatment with trametinib and 
      everolimus resulted in frequent treatment-related adverse events, including 
      mucosal inflammation (40%), stomatitis (25%), fatigue (54%), and diarrhea (42%). 
      PK assessment did not suggest drug-drug interactions between these two agents. Of 
      the 67 enrolled patients, 5 (7%) achieved partial response (PR) to treatment and 
      21 (31%) displayed stable disease (SD). Among the 21 patients with pancreatic 
      cancer, PR was observed in 1 patient (5%) and SD in 6 patients (29%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study was unable to identify a recommended phase II dose and 
      schedule of trametinib in combination with everolimus that provided an acceptable 
      tolerability and adequate drug exposure.

AB  - Everolimus displays antiproliferative effects on cancer cells, yields 
      antiangiogenic activity in established tumours, and shows synergistic activity 
      with paclitaxel in preclinical models. This study assessed the safety and the 
      pharmacokinetic interactions of everolimus and paclitaxel in patients with 
      advanced malignancies. Everolimus was dose escalated from 15 to 30 mg and 
      administered with paclitaxel 80 mg m(-2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. 
      Safety was assessed weekly, and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated in 
      cycle 1. A total of 16 patients (median age 54.5 years, range 33-69) were 
      entered; 11 had prior taxane therapy for breast (n=5), ovarian (n=3), and vaginal 
      cancer (n=1) or angiosarcoma (n=2). Grade 3 neutropenia in six patients met the 
      criteria for DLT in two patients receiving everolimus 30 mg weekly. Other 
      drug-related grade 3 toxicities were leucopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, 
      stomatitis, asthenia, and increased liver enzymes. Tumour stabilisation reported 
      in 11 patients exceeded 6 months in 2 patients with breast cancer. Everolimus 
      showed an acceptable safety profile at the dose of 30 mg when combined with 
      weekly paclitaxel 80 mg m(-2), warranting further clinical investigation.

AB  - The narrow therapeutic index and large inter-individual variability in sirolimus 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) make therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) necessary. Factors 
      responsible for PK variability are not well understood, and published PK studies 
      do not include pediatric patients with immune cytopenia. The objective of this 
      study was to characterize the PK of sirolimus in pediatric patients with immune 
      cytopenia and to develop a population PK model in Chinese children and evaluate 
      its utility for dose individualization. A total of 27 children with either 
      acquired or congenital immune cytopenia aged 8.16 ± 3.60 years (range: 
      1-15 years) were included. TDM data for sirolimus were collected. The population 
      PK model of sirolimus was described using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling 
      (Phoenix NLME 1.3 software) approach. Covariate analysis was applied to select 
      candidate factors associated with PK parameters. The final model was validated 
      using bootstrap (1000 runs) and visual predictive check (VPC) method. A 
      one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination was developed. 
      The outcome parameters were as follows: apparent clearance (CL/F) 5.63 L/h, 
      apparent distribution volume (V/F) 144.16 L. Inter-individual variabilities for 
      CL/F and V/F were 3.53% and 7.27%, respectively. The intra-individual variability 
      of proportional error model was 22.45%. The covariate test found that body weight 
      and total bilirubin were strongly associated with clearance; however, we did not 
      find the relevance between the covariate and volume of distribution of sirolimus. 
      Personalized dosage regimens were provided based on Bayesian method. The oral 
      dose should be adjusted according to weight and total bilirubin. This is the 
      first study to describe a population PK model of sirolimusin pediatric patients 
      with immune cytopenia. Population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model-based dose 
      individualization of sirolimus and the design of future clinical studies in 
      children will be facilitated by the developed model in this study.

AB  - Mycophenolate drug levels are decreased by co-administration of cyclosporine. 
      However, mycophenolate levels may be associated with insufficient 
      immunosuppression. We investigated the pharmacokinetics of 720 mg mycophenolate 
      sodium (EC-MPS) and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity under 
      co-medication with cyclosporine and steroids within the first 30 d after kidney 
      transplantation (n = 24). Blood samples were drawn at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 
      8, and 12 h after the morning dose. Plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid, 
      its glucuronide metabolites (MPAG; AcMPAG), and free MPA were determined using 
      validated HPLC-DAD. IMPDH activity in leukocytes was analyzed 
      chromatographically. Only six of 24 patients had an MPA-AUC(12h) within the 
      putative therapeutic range of 40-60 mg/L·h. MPA clearance was high with 29 L/h. 
      fMPA-AUC(12h) (r = -0.429, p = 0.04) and MPAG-AUC(12h) correlated significantly 
      with the glomerular filtration rate, while total MPA did not. The MPAG-AUC(12h) 
      was about 52-fold higher than the corresponding values for MPA, whereas the 
      AcMPAG-AUC(12h) reached about 20.4% of the respective MPA-AUC(12h.) We found 
      significant correlations between IMPDH inhibition and MPA concentration (r = 
      -0.665; p < 0.0001), fMPA (r = -0.446; p = 0.003), and AcMPAG (r = -0.459; p = 
      0.002) but not with MPAG. Only 25% of the patients attained the therapeutic range 
      for MPA-AUC under standard EC-MPS dose during the early-phase 
      post-transplantation. We recommend that EC-MPS should be given in higher doses (3 
      × 720 mg) in the early post-transplant period when co-administered with 
      cyclosporine.

TI  - Impact of CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of 
      cyclosporine and sirolimus in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 36-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine, CsA) and mTOR inhibitors 
      (sirolimus, SRL) - immunosuppressants used to prevent allograft rejection after 
      renal transplantation - have a narrow therapeutic index and show considerable 
      inter-individual pharmacokinetic differences. Differences in expression and 
      activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 3A5 affect these pharmacokinetics; 
      cytochrome activity differences are associated with CYP genetic polymorphisms. 
      MATERIAL/METHODS: This study evaluated the effects of polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and 
      CYP3A5 on immunosuppressive drug-dose adjusted trough blood concentrations. One 
      hundred renal transplant recipients were genotyped for CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A5*3 
      using PCR-RFLP. Blood concentrations of CsA and SRL were determined by EMIT and 
      HPLC/UV, respectively. RESULTS: The allelic frequencies of CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A5*3 
      in the study group were 2.5% and 96.5%, respectively. The mean cyclosporine dose 
      in CYP3A4*1/*1B subjects was 455.04±128.68 mg/day vs. 261.68±64.72 mg/day in 
      CYP3A4*1/*1 subjects (p<0.001). The mean cyclosporine dose-adjusted trough blood 
      concentrations (ng/ml per mg/kg body weight) in CYP3A4*1/*1B subjects were lower 
      than in the CYP3A4*1/*1 group (37.06±10.38 vs. 44.63±13.99; p<0.218). The mean 
      cyclosporine dose in CYP3A5*1/*3 subjects was 400.65±164.97 mg/day vs. 
      263.52±64.39 mg/day in CYP3A5*3/*3 subjects (p<0.022). No association was 
      detected between sirolimus trough blood concentration (C0) or dose requirement, 
      and CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and 
      CYP3A5 may underlie inter-individual differences in cyclosporine pharmacokinetics 
      after renal transplantation. Patients with at least 1 functional CYP3A5*1 or 
      CYP3A4*1B allele require significantly higher doses of cyclosporine to reach 
      target drug levels compared to patients with the CYP3A4*1 or CYP3A5*3 alleles.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics of Biolimus A9 after elution from the BioMatrix II stent in 
      patients with coronary artery disease: the Stealth PK Study.
PG  - 389-398
LID - 10.1007/s00228-010-0895-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This prospective, open-label multicenter study was conducted to 
      assess the pharmacokinetics of Biolimus A9 after elution from BioMatrix II 
      coronary stents. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety 
      of Biolimus A9 eluted from different stent platforms. To date, the 
      pharmacokinetics of Biolimus A9 in patients following the deployment of BioMatrix 
      II stents has not yet been studied METHODS: BioMatrix II stents were implanted 
      into 27 patients with coronary artery disease. The primary endpoints of the study 
      were the systemic concentrations of Biolimus A9 after 28 days and 6 months as 
      measured using a sensitive validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry assay. RESULTS: The highest measured blood concentration at any time 
      point was 394 pg/mL. At 28 days and 6 months following stent placement, 51.8 and 
      100% of patients, respectively, had Biolimus A9 concentrations <10 pg/mL. After 9 
      months, 100% of the patients were free of major cardiac adverse events (MACE). 
      There was no Biolimus A9 toxicity, no cardiac or non-cardiac deaths, no 
      myocardial infarctions, nor target vessel or target lesion revascularizations 
      during the 9 months of follow-up. No case of acute, subacute, or late stent 
      thrombosis was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other drug-eluting stents, such 
      as Cypher, BioMatrix II results in relatively low systemic exposure, which may be 
      explained by the ablominal coating of the Biomatrix II stent in combination with 
      Biolimus A9's high lipophilicity.

TI  - A phase I study of tivantinib in combination with temsirolimus in patients with 
      advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 290-297
LID - 10.1007/s10637-016-0418-8 [doi]
AB  - Background A wide variety of human cancers exhibit dysregulated c-Met activity 
      that has implications in oncogenesis. Phosphorylation of c-Met results in 
      activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Combined blockade of c-Met and mTOR 
      pathways has shown efficacy in preclinical studies. Tivantinib is a c-Met 
      inhibitor and temsirolimus is a selective mTOR inhibitor. We aimed to determine 
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), 
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), adverse events (AEs), clinical activity and 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of the combination. Methods This open-label phase 
      I study used a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. Patients (pts) were treated with 
      escalating doses of tivantinib (120-360 mg tablets orally twice daily) and 
      temsirolimus (20 mg IV weekly) followed by dose expansion at the MTD. Separate 
      cohorts were planned for extensive (normal) and poor tivantinib metabolizers 
      based on CYP2C19 genotypes. Cycles were 28 days besides cycle 1 that was 35 days 
      to allow for PK analysis. Results Twenty-nine pts. [median age 58 (range 28-77)] 
      were enrolled (21 in dose escalation and 8 in dose expansion). All were extensive 
      CYP2C19 metabolizers. The most common types of cancer were colorectal, ovarian 
      and non-small cell lung. Sixteen out of 21 and 6 out of 8 pts. were evaluable for 
      DLT evaluation per protocol in the dose escalation and dose expansion phases, 
      respectively. Pts remained on study for a median of 71 days (range 18-296). The 
      MTD and RP2D was tivantinib 240 mg twice daily and temsirolimus 20 mg weekly. 
      DLTs included grade (gr) 4 neutropenia (2 pts.; 1 with gr 3 febrile neutropenia), 
      gr 3 abdominal pain (1 pt) and gr 2 mucositis resulting in inadequate drug 
      delivery. The most common treatment related AEs grade ≥ 2 included: anemia (gr 2 
      in 9 pts., gr 3 in 3 pts), fatigue (gr 2 in 10 pts), anorexia (gr 2 in 9 pts), 
      hypoalbuminemia (gr 2 in 6 pts., gr 3 in 2 pts), hypophosphatemia (gr 2 in 2 
      pts., gr 3 in 5 pts) and nausea (gr 2 in 6 pts., gr 3 in 1 pt). One pt. with 
      ovarian cancer had a confirmed partial response and remained on study for 
      10 months, a second patient with ovarian cancer had stable disease and remained 
      on study for 6 months and a third pt. with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue 
      had stable disease and remained on study for 7 months. Pharmacokinetic analysis 
      showed that there is no interaction in the plasma concentrations between 
      tivantinib and temsirolimus. Conclusions The combination of tivantinib with 
      temsirolimus appears to be well tolerated with evidence of clinical activity.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of rapamycin-eluting stents in miniswine coronary model.
PG  - 1459-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: The results of clinical trials of rapamycin-eluting stents reduce 
      restenosis have been quite promising. The main purpose of this study was to 
      characterize the in vivo pharmacokinetics of high dose rapamycin (Rapa)-eluting 
      stents in a miniswine coronary model. METHODS: Ten miniswines underwent placement 
      of 18 high dose Rapa-eluting stents in the left anterior descending and right 
      coronary arteries. At the planned times of the 1.5th, 12th, 24th hour, 3th, 7th 
      and 28th day, the animals (n = 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, and 2, respectively) were 
      euthanized after completion of coronary angiography. Blood samples were obtained 
      at 0, 10, 20, 30 minutes; 1, 2, 6, 24 hours; and 3, 7, 28 days to determine 
      systemic Rapa levels. Rapa levels in whole blood, arterial wall, heart, renal and 
      liver tissues were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass 
      spectroscopy. RESULTS: Peak whole blood concentration (Cmax), time to peak 
      concentration (tmax), elimination half-life (t1/2beta), area under the curve 
      (AUC), and apparent systemic clearance (Cl/F) were (10.91 +/- 1.28) ng/ml, (2.0 
      +/- 0.2) hours, (7.25 +/- 0.63) hours, (1.15 +/- 0.11) ng x h x ml(-1), and (180 
      +/- 12) ml x h(-1) x kg(-1), respectively. More than 95% Rapa detected is 
      localized in the coronary artery surrounding the stent and heart. CONCLUSION: 
      Stent-based delivery of Rapa via a copolymer stent is feasible and safe. This 
      strategy holds promise for the prevention of stent restenosis.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic analysis after implantation of everolimus-eluting self-expanding 
      stents in the peripheral vasculature.
PG  - 400-5
LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2011.08.048 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel self-expanding drug-eluting stent was designed to release 
      everolimus 225 μg/cm(2) to prevent restenosis following peripheral arterial 
      intervention. The purpose of this study was to measure the pharmacokinetic 
      profile of everolimus following stent implantation. METHODS: One hundred four 
      patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease underwent implantation of 
      everolimus-eluting stents in the femoropopliteal arteries. In a prespecified 
      subset of 26 patients, blood samples for assay of everolimus content were 
      collected prior to stent implantation, at 1, 4, and 8 hours postprocedure, prior 
      to discharge, and at 1 month postprocedure. RESULTS: A total of 39 stents, 
      ranging from 28 mm to 100 mm in length, were implanted in 26 patients, resulting 
      in a total delivered everolimus dose range of 3.0 to 7.6 mg. Following the 
      procedure, the maximum observed everolimus blood concentrations (C(max)) varied 
      from 1.83 ± 0.05 ng/mL after implantation of a single 80-mm stent to 4.66 ± 1.78 
      ng/mL after implantation of two 100-mm stents. The mean time to peak 
      concentration (T(max)) varied from 6.8 hours to 35 hours. The pharmacokinetics of 
      everolimus were dose-proportional in that dose-normalized C(max) and area under 
      the curve values were constant over the studied dose range. CONCLUSIONS: After 
      implantation of everolimus-eluting self-expanding stents in the femoropopliteal 
      arteries, systemic blood concentrations of everolimus are predictable and 
      considerably lower than blood concentrations observed following safe oral 
      administration of everolimus.

AB  - AIMS: This study was aimed at determining the population pharmacokinetics of 
      sirolimus and identifying factors that explain pharmacokinetic variability in de 
      novo Chinese adult renal transplant patients. METHODS: Data were retrospectively 
      extracted from a formal multicentre clinical trial, which was originally designed 
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cyclosporin dose reduction and cyclosporin 
      elimination in patients receiving sirolimus. All patients received 12-month 
      treatment, i.e. induction therapy with cyclosporin, sirolimus and corticosteroids 
      during the first 3 months followed by either cyclosporin dose reduction or 
      cyclosporin discontinuation thereafter. Eight-hundred and four sirolimus trough 
      blood concentrations (C(0)) from 112 patients were used to develop a population 
      pharmacokinetic model using the NONMEM program. A one-compartment model with 
      first-order absorption and elimination was selected as the base model. The 
      influence of demographic characteristics, biochemical and haematological indices, 
      cyclosporin daily dose, cyclosporin C(0) as well as other commonly used 
      co-medications were explored. RESULTS: The typical values with interindividual 
      variability for apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution 
      (V/F) were 10.1 l h(-1) (23.8%) and 3670 l (56.7%), respectively. The residual 
      variability was 29.9%. CL/F decreased significantly with silymarin or 
      glycyrrhizin co-therapy in hepatically impaired patients, and with increasing 
      total cholesterol levels or cyclosporin C(0). Moreover, CL/F increased 
      nonlinearly with increasing sirolimus daily dose. The median parameter estimates 
      from a nonparametric bootstrap procedure were comparable and within 5% of the 
      estimates from NONMEM. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide important information 
      for clinicians to optimize sirolimus regimens in Chinese renal transplant 
      patients.

TI  - A phase I study of ridaforolimus in adult Chinese patients with advanced solid 
      tumors.
PG  - 48
LID - 10.1186/1756-8722-6-48 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ridaforolimus (AP23573, MK-8669 or deforolimus) is an inhibitor of 
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), an important regulator in the cell survival 
      pathway. This open-label, single center phase I study aimed to investigate the 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles of ridaforolimus in Chinese patients 
      with treatment-refractory advanced or relapsed solid tumors. The PK data 
      generated from these Chinese patients were further compared with those previously 
      reported in Caucasian and Japanese patient populations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The 
      patients were given an oral dose of 40 mg of ridaforolimus on Day 1 of the study. 
      On Day 8, patients were initiated on a treatment regimen that comprised a once 
      daily dose of 40 mg of ridaforolimus for five consecutive days, followed by a 
      2-day off-drug interval. Patients repeated this regimen until disease progression 
      or intolerance. Blood samples were collected at specific times pre- and 
      post-treatment to establish the PK profile of ridaforolimus in all patients. 
      RESULTS: Fifteen patients were given at least one dose of 40 mg of ridaforolimus. 
      The median absorption lag-time was 2 hours, the median Tmax was 4 hours and the 
      mean elimination half-life was 53 hours. The accumulation ratio for AUC(0-24hr) 
      was 1.3 on day 19 (steady state)/day 1 (after a single dose). The most common 
      drug-related adverse events (AEs) that occurred in ≥40% of patients were 
      stomatitis, proteinuria, leukopenia, hyperglycemia, and pyrexia. Grade 3/4 
      drug-related AEs were anemia, stomatitis, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, 
      constipation, gamma glutamyltransferase increase, and proteinuria. All 11 
      evaluable patients achieved stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: Oral ridaforolimus at a 
      daily dose of 40 mg were generally well tolerated in Chinese patients with 
      advanced or refractory solid tumors. Adverse events and PK profiles of 
      ridaforolimus in this study were similar to those from Caucasian and Japanese 
      patients reported previously.

TI  - Dose-dependent pharmacokinetics of rapamycin-28-N,N-dimethylglycinate in the 
      mouse.
PG  - 325-30
AB  - Rapamycin-28-N,N-dimethylglycinate methanesulfonate salt (RG), synthesized as a 
      potential water-soluble prodrug to facilitate parenteral administration of the 
      antineoplastic macrolide rapamycin (RA), is active against intracranially 
      implanted human glioma in mice. Preclinical pharmacokinetic studies to evaluate 
      the prodrug were conducted in male CD2F1 mice treated with 10, 25, 50 and 100 
      mg/kg doses of RG by rapid i.v. injection. The plasma concentration of RG decayed 
      in a distinctly triphasic manner following treatment with the 100 mg/kg dose; 
      however, prodrug disposition was apparent biexponential at each of the lower 
      doses. RG exhibited dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, characterized by an increase 
      in the total plasma clearance from 12.5 to 39.3 ml.min-1.kg-1 for dosage 
      escalations in the range 10-50 mg/kg, while clearance values at doses of 50 and 
      100 mg/kg were similar. The terminal rate constants decreased linearly as the 
      dose was increased from 10 to 100 mg/kg, eliciting an apparent prolongation of 
      the biological half-life from 2.1 to 4.8 h. There was also a sequential increase 
      in the steady state apparent volume of distribution from 1.73 to 8.75 l/kg. These 
      observations are consistent with saturable binding of RG to plasma proteins while 
      binding to tissue remains linear. Nevertheless, conversion to RA appeared to 
      represent a prominent route of RG elimination. The molar plasma concentration of 
      RA exceeded that of the prodrug within 30-90 min after i.v. treatment and 
      declined very slowly thereafter, with plasma levels sustained between 0.1 and 10 
      microM for 48 h at each of the doses evaluated. Thus, RG effectively served as a 
      slow release delivery system for RA, implying the possibility of maintaining 
      therapeutic plasma levels of the drug from a more convenient dosing regimen than 
      a continuous infusion schedule. The present findings, coupled with the 
      demonstrated in vivo activity of RG against human brain tumor models, warrant its 
      continued development as a much needed chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment 
      of brain neoplasms.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacoimmunodynamic interactions between prednisolone and 
      sirolimus in adrenalectomized rats.
PG  - 1-21
AB  - Prednisolone (Pred) and sirolimus (SIR) are immunosuppressive compounds acting 
      through different mechanisms with moderate synergism found in vitro. Both drugs 
      are metabolized partly by CYP3A enzymes. After i.v. administration of placebo, 
      Pred (5 mg/kg), SIR (1 mg/kg), or Pred with SIR (5 and 1 mg/kg doses) to 
      adrenalectomized male rats, Pred plasma and SIR whole blood concentrations were 
      followed for 48 hr along with circulating T-helper and T-cytotoxic cell counts. 
      Ex vivo whole blood lymphocyte proliferation marked host responsiveness. An 
      extended indirect PK/PD model was used to describe responses to these drugs, 
      alone or combined. An interactive two-stage population analysis showed no 
      modification in drug PK. Mean Pred plasma clearance was 0.655 L/hr (interrat++ 
      variability: 11%) and significantly increased with weight. Mean SIR whole blood 
      volume of distribution and clearance were 5.6 L (62%) and 0.28 L/hr (32%), and 
      animal scaling showed weight-power proportionality. In vitro metabolism studies 
      showed no significant inhibition of Pred or prednisone CYP3A metabolism by SIR 
      (50 microM), but this pathway accounted for less than 5% of Pred metabolism. Pred 
      decreased numbers of T-helper lymphocytes with a mean IC50 of 37.8 nM (21%) alone 
      or 12.3 nM (130%) with SIR. Results for T-cytotoxic lymphocytes were similar. SIR 
      increased lymphocyte numbers with a mean IC50 of 52.2 nM (24%) for T-helper and 
      28.8 nM (51%) for T-cytotoxic cells. Taking into account drug effects on 
      lymphocyte trafficking, Pred directly inhibited ex vivo lymphocyte proliferation 
      with a mean IC50 of 1.08 nM (38%). SIR, after a transduction step, inhibited 
      proliferation with a mean IC50 of 1.00 nM (26%). Responses measured after drug 
      coadministration were reasonably quantitated by addition of single drug effects. 
      Since, at pharmacologic concentrations in rats, Pred and SIR did not interact in 
      their PK but synergistically or additively interact in their dynamics, their 
      joint therapeutic use is promising. The adrenalectomized rat may be a suitable 
      animal model to characterize drug effects on lymphocyte trafficking and 
      reactivity.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and Long-Term Safety and Tolerability of Everolimus in Renal 
      Transplant Recipients Converted From Cyclosporine.
PG  - 64-72
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000236 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conversion from cyclosporine (CsA) to everolimus (EVR) in kidney 
      transplant recipients receiving mycophenolate sodium (MPS) and corticosteroids 
      has been used to reduce CsA associated toxicities. Nevertheless, exposures 
      produced by the initial EVR dose, the steady state pharmacokinetic and long-term 
      safety and tolerability have not been explored in detail. METHODS: Twenty-four 
      stable kidney transplant recipients receiving CSA, MPS, and corticosteroids were 
      converted from CSA to EVR. The initial EVR dose was 3 mg BID. Weekly monitoring 
      of EVR blood concentrations was followed by a full 12 hour pharmacokinetic 
      profile 28 days after conversion. Therapeutic drug monitoring, safety, and 
      tolerability were analyzed during 5 years of follow-up. RESULTS: The study 
      population was relatively young (mean of 42 years) with a predominance of males 
      (62%) and White (67%) recipients of kidneys from living (54%) or deceased (46%) 
      donors. Mean time of the conversion was 61 months after transplantation. In the 
      first 7 patients, the initial EVR dose of 3 mg BID resulted in mean EVR trough 
      blood concentration of 14.7 ± 3.7 ng/mL at day 7. The initial EVR dose was then 
      reduced to 2 mg BID for the following 17 patients. Four weeks after conversion, 
      mean EVR dose was 1.7 ± 0.5 mg BID (7 patients were receiving 1 mg BID and 17 
      were receiving 2 mg BID) resulting in mean EVR trough blood concentration of 4.0 
      ± 1.4 ng/mL. Whereas mean maximum concentration (13.4 ± 2.8 versus 22.9 ± 7.4 
      ng/mL, P = 0.003) and mean apparent clearance (232 ± 79 versus 366 ± 173 mL/min, 
      P = 0.016) were higher, mean area under the curve (78.2 ± 22.1 versus 102.5 ± 
      38.5 ng.h/mL, P = 0.067) and mean C0 (3.7 ± 1.3 versus 4.1 ± 1.5 ng/mL, P = 
      0.852) were no different comparing patients receiving 1 mg and 2 mg EVR BID. Mean 
      inter-subject variability of area under the curve, trough concentration, and 
      maximum concentration was 38%, 36%, and 38%. EVR treatment was discontinued in 
      29% of patients due to proteinuria (N = 2), pneumonia (N = 2), dyslipidemia (N = 
      2), and anemia (N = 1) and MPS dose was reduced in 58% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The initial 3 mg BID dose produced high EVR trough blood concentrations. The 2 mg 
      BID dose appears to be the appropriate initial dose to provide therapeutic 
      concentrations but still requires initial intensive therapeutic monitoring to 
      achieve and maintain blood concentrations within the therapeutic target 
      concentration. The combination of EVR and full dose MPS has limited long-term 
      tolerability and safety.

TI  - Effect of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of everolimus and tacrolimus in a 
      heart transplant recipient: Case report.
PG  - 270-276
LID - 10.5414/CP203209 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Everolimus is an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
      and has been used in combination with calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and 
      cyclosporine) to prevent allograft rejection following organ transplantation. In 
      heart transplant recipients, everolimus should be maintained at a target blood 
      concentration of 3 - 8 ng/mL, in combination with reduced-dose calcineurin 
      inhibitors and therefore, requires strict monitoring. Fluconazole, an azole 
      antifungal agent, affects blood concentration of tacrolimus by inhibiting the 
      cytochromes P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 3A5. Therefore, to avoid overexposure during 
      everolimus-azole cotreatment, the dose of everolimus should be reduced. However, 
      the mechanism of interaction between everolimus and fluconazole remains unclear. 
      CASE REPORT: We report the case of a heart transplant recipient who experienced a 
      2.8-fold increase in everolimus clearance and a 3.5-fold increase in everolimus 
      dosage, following withdrawal of fluconazole therapy. The clearance and dosage of 
      tacrolimus increased 4.7- and 3.0-fold, respectively. CONCLUSION: The 
      concentrations of everolimus and tacrolimus should be carefully monitored when 
      administered concomitantly with fluconazole to heart transplant recipients. The 
      patient in this case had a CYP3A5*1/*3 genotype, and CYP3A5 constituted the 
      metabolic pathway. Therefore, concomitant use of fluconazole might have a 
      relatively small impact on everolimus and tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in this 
      case. .

TI  - Sotrastaurin and everolimus pharmacokinetics after single-dose coadministration.
PG  - 103-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sotrastaurin is an immunosuppressant that blocks T-lymphocyte 
      activation via protein kinase C inhibition. The authors determined whether a 
      pharmacokinetic interaction occurs between sotrastaurin and everolimus, both of 
      which are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4. METHODS: This was a randomized, 
      three-period, crossover study in 18 healthy subjects. They received single oral 
      doses of (1) 100 mg sotrastaurin, (2) 2 mg everolimus, and (3) the drug 
      combination. Clinical and pharmacokinetic data were collected to Day 5 after each 
      treatment. RESULTS: Coadministration of everolimus decreased sotrastaurin C(max) 
      from 638 +/- 295 to 539 +/- 211 ng/ml yielding a combination/ monotherapy ratio 
      (90% confidence interval) of 0.87 (0.76 - 1.00). Sotrastaurin total AUC was not 
      altered by everolimus with values of 3660 +/- 1853 versus 3630 +/- 2006 ng*h/ml 
      and a ratio of 1.00 (0.88 - 1.13). Sotrastaurin increased everolimus C(max) from 
      15 +/- 6 to 16 +/- 6 ng/ml yielding a ratio of 1.15 (0.99 - 1.33) and increased 
      everolimus total AUC from 114 +/- 50 to 137 +/- 56 ng*h/ml yielding a ratio of 
      1.20 (1.05 - 1.37). The possibility that a higher dose of sotrastaurin than used 
      in this study might further increase everolimus blood levels cannot be excluded. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Coadministration of a single 100 mg dose sotrastaurin with a single 
      2 mg dose everolimus did not alter sotrastaurin pharmacokinetics to a clinically 
      relevant extent. Everolimus AUC was increased 20% by sotrastaurin.

TI  - Association of NR1I2, CYP3A5 and ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms with variability of 
      temsirolimus pharmacokinetics and toxicity in patients with metastatic bladder 
      cancer.
PG  - 653-659
LID - 10.1007/s00280-017-3379-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Temsirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor that 
      exhibits antitumor activity in renal cell carcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma. The 
      metabolism of temsirolimus and its active metabolite sirolimus mainly depends on 
      cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/A5) and the ABCB1 transporter. Differently from 
      sirolimus, no pharmacogenetic study on temsirolimus has been conducted. 
      Therefore, the aim of this pilot study was to identify genetic determinants of 
      the inter-individual variability in temsirolimus pharmacokinetics and toxicity. 
      METHODS: Pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained for 16 patients with bladder 
      cancer after intravenous infusion of 25 mg temsirolimus. Non-compartmental 
      analysis was performed to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
      temsirolimus and sirolimus, its main metabolite. The presence of single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP3A5, ABCB1 and in their transcriptional 
      regulator NR1I2 (PXR) was assessed by genotyping. Non-parametric statistical 
      tests were used to assess associations between candidate SNPs and temsirolimus 
      pharmacokinetics and toxicity. RESULTS: The ratio between sirolimus AUC and 
      temsirolimus AUC was 1.6-fold higher in patients who experienced serious toxic 
      events (p = 0.034). The frequency of adverse events was significantly higher in 
      patients homozygous for the NR1I2-rs6785049 A allele (OR = 0.065, p = 0.04) or 
      NR1I2-rs3814055 C allele (OR = 0.032, p = 0.006). These NR1I2 SNPs were also 
      predictive of temsirolimus half-life and global exposure to temsirolimus and 
      sirolimus. Finally, the effect of the ABCB1-rs1128503, ABCB1-rs2032582 and 
      CYP3A5*3 SNPs on sirolimus pharmacokinetics was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings suggest that SNPs of NR1I2 and its target genes CYP3A5 and ABCB1 are 
      genetic determinants of temsirolimus pharmacokinetics and toxicity in patients 
      with bladder cancer.

TI  - Effect of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 Genetic Polymorphisms on the Pharmacokinetics of 
      Sirolimus in Healthy Chinese Volunteers.
PG  - 406-411
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000415 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is a promising immunosuppressive drug for preventing the 
      rejection of organ transplants. However, inter-individual variability in 
      sirolimus pharmacokinetics causes adverse drug reactions, compromising 
      therapeutic efficacy. Sirolimus is primarily metabolized by cytochrome CYP3A4 and 
      CYP3A5. This study aimed to clarify the effect of CYP3A genetic polymorphisms, 
      including the CYP3A4*1G and CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms, on the pharmacokinetics of 
      sirolimus. METHODS: Thirty-one healthy Chinese volunteers were included in this 
      study. Their genotypes were determined using the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX 
      platform, and blood sirolimus concentrations at different time points were 
      analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The 
      pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using WinNonlin version 5.2 software. 
      RESULTS: The allele frequencies of CYP3A4*1G and CYP3A5*3 were 25.8% and 71.0%, 
      respectively. In CYP3A4*1G carriers (n = 13), the area under the curve AUC0-144, 
      AUC0-∞, and Cmax were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than CYP3A4*1/*1 homozygous 
      subjects (n = 18). Briefly, the AUC0-144, AUC0-∞, and Cmax of *1G/*1G carrier 
      were 315.2 ± 91.5, 372.0 ± 108.2, and 10.2 ± 1.6 ng/mL, respectively, and those 
      of *1/*1 G*1/*1 G carrier were 440.8 ± 130.6, 537.4 ± 167.5, and 13.7 ± 4.3, 
      respectively, whereas those of CYP3A4*1/*1 homozygous subjects were 540.2 ± 
      150.6, 626.6 ± 166.9, and 19.8 ± 7.5 ng/mL, respectively. In CYP3A5-nonexpressing 
      subjects (*3/*3 homozygous carriers, n = 15), the AUC0-144 and Cmax were 549.6 ± 
      137.9 and 19.9 ± 7.9 ng/mL, respectively, and were significantly higher (P < 
      0.05) than the values in CYP3A5-expressing subjects (*1/*1homozygous carrier, n = 
      2; 314.2 ± 129.3 and 10.3 ± 2.2 ng/mL; *1/*3 heterozygous carrier, n = 15; 440.2 
      ± 146.3 and 14.6 ± 5.1 ng/mL, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 
      genetic polymorphisms are important factors affecting pharmacokinetic parameters 
      of sirolimus. Our data support the monitoring of blood sirolimus concentrations, 
      especially in CYP3A5*1 and CYP3A4*1 G carriers, to ensure accurate dosing in the 
      clinical setting.

PG  - 447-51
AB  - It was recently shown in two randomized studies that combining sirolimus 
      (rapamycin) and tacrolimus is very efficient in renal transplantation. However, 
      little is known about the long-term pharmacokinetics of this combination. We 
      performed simultaneous AUC measurements (area under the concentration curves) of 
      sirolimus and tacrolimus at 1, 3, and 12 months posttransplantation in nine de 
      novo recipients treated with this drug combination to characterize the evolution 
      of the pharmacokinetics of both drugs and to investigate possible interactions 
      between the two compounds. Patients were treated with a standard-dose tacrolimus 
      or with a reduced-dose tacrolimus in combination with sirolimus and 
      corticosteroids. This long-term pharmacokinetic study has shown that when 
      sirolimus is combined with tacrolimus, dose changes of sirolimus are reflected by 
      pharmacokinetic exposure parameters. Patients taking a low dose of sirolimus in 
      combination with a standard dose tacrolimus might require sirolimus dose 
      increments over time to maintain constant exposure to sirolimus. Further 
      prospective dose-controlled studies are necessary to investigate a possible 
      effect of a standard-dose tacrolimus on long-term sirolimus bioavailability 
      and/or metabolism. Dose reductions of tacrolimus in both study groups were 
      reflected by concordant decreasing pharmacokinetic exposure parameters, which 
      illustrates the common clinical practice of reducing the dose of calcineurin 
      inhibitor as time elapses after transplantation.

TI  - Pharmacometrics and delivery of novel nanoformulated 
      PEG-b-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) micelles of rapamycin.
PG  - 133-44
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the pharmacokinetics, tissue, and blood distribution of 
      rapamycin PEG-block-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PEG-b-PCL) micelle formulations 
      with and without the addition of alpha-tocopherol compared to control rapamycin 
      in Tween 80/PEG 400/N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) (7:64:29). METHODS: Rapamycin was 
      incorporated at 10% w/w into PEG-b-PCL micelles (5:10 kDa) using a solvent 
      extraction technique. The co-incorporation of 2:1 alpha-tocopherol:PEG-b-PCL was 
      also studied. Rapamycin was quantified utilizing LC/MS in a Waters XTerra MS C18 
      column with 32-desmethoxyrapamycin as the internal standard. Male Sprague Dawley 
      rats (N = 4 per group; approximately 200 g) were cannulated via the left jugular 
      and dosed intravenously (IV) with the rapamycin control and micelle formulations 
      (10 mg/kg, 1:9 ratio for rapamycin to PEG-b-PCL). For tissue distribution 24 h 
      after IV dosing, whole blood, plasma, red blood cells, and all the representative 
      tissues were collected. The tissues were rapidly frozen under liquid nitrogen and 
      ground to a fine powder. The rapamycin concentrations in plasma and red blood 
      cells were utilized to determine the blood distribution (partition coefficient 
      between plasma and red blood cells). For the determination of the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters, blood, plasma, and urine samples were collected over 48 h. The 
      pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using WinNonlin(R) (Version 5.1) 
      software. RESULTS: Rapamycin concentrations were considerably less in brain after 
      administration of both micelle formulations compared to a rapamycin in the Tween 
      80/PEG 400/DMA control group. There was a 2-fold and 1.6-fold increase in the 
      plasma fraction for rapamycin micelles with and without alpha-tocopherol. There 
      was a decrease in volume of distribution for both formulations, an increase in 
      AUC, a decrease in clearance, and increase in half life respectively for 
      rapamycin in PEG-b-PCL + alpha-tocopherol micelles and in PEG-b-PCL micelles. 
      There was no mortality with the micelle formulations compared to 60% mortality 
      with rapamycin in Tween 80/PEG 400/DMA. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased distribution 
      into the brain of rapamycin in PEG-b-PCL micelles may ameliorate rapamycin 
      neurotoxicity. Both micelle formulations increase rapamycin distribution in 
      plasma, which could facilitate access into solid tumors. The micellar delivery 
      systems of rapamycin impart in vivo controlled release, resulting in altered 
      disposition, and dramatically reduced mortality.

TI  - Phase I study of everolimus in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 4806-12
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities 
      (DLTs), and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the mammalian 
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, everolimus, in children with refractory or 
      recurrent solid tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Everolimus was administered orally 
      at a daily dose of 2.1, 3, 5, or 6.5 mg/m2 in cohorts of three to six patients 
      per dosage level. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were performed 
      during the first course. The phosphorylation status of various components of the 
      mTOR signal pathway was assessed in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
      isolated from treated patients. RESULTS: There were 26 patients enrolled; 18 were 
      assessable. DLTs included diarrhea (n = 1), mucositis (n = 1), and elevation of 
      ALT (n = 1) at 6.5 mg/m2. At the MTD of 5 mg/m2, the median everolimus clearance 
      was 15.2 L/h/m2, with a plasma everolimus concentration-time area under the curve 
      (AUC) from 0 to infinity of 239.6 ng/mL x h. Significant inhibition of mTOR 
      pathway signaling was observed in PBMCs from patients achieving AUCs 200 ng/mL x 
      h, equivalent to dosages of 3 to 5 mg/m2 of everolimus. No objective tumor 
      responses were observed. CONCLUSION: Continuous, orally administered everolimus 
      is well tolerated in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors and 
      demonstrates similar pharmacokinetic properties to those observed in adults. 
      Everolimus significantly inhibits the mTOR signaling pathway in children at the 
      MTD. The recommended phase II dose in children with solid tumors is 5 mg/m2.

TI  - Safety and pharmacokinetics of escalated doses of weekly intravenous infusion of 
      CCI-779, a novel mTOR inhibitor, in patients with cancer.
PG  - 2336-47
AB  - PURPOSE: To establish the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic parameters of 
      CCI-779, a selective inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, in patients 
      with advanced cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a modified continuous 
      reassessment method, we performed a phase I with pharmacokinetic study of CCI-779 
      given as a weekly 30 minutes intravenous (I.V.) infusion. RESULTS: Twenty-four 
      patients received CCI-779 at doses ranging 7.5 to 220 mg/m(2). No 
      immunosuppressive effect was reported. Dose-limiting thrombocytopenia occurred in 
      two patients at 34 or 45 mg/m(2). At 220 mg/m(2), dose-limiting toxicities 
      consisted of manic-depressive syndrome, stomatitis, and asthenia in two of nine 
      patients, preventing further dose escalation. The most frequent drug-related 
      toxicities were acne-like, maculopapular rashes and mucositis or stomatitis. All 
      toxicities were reversible on treatment discontinuation. Maximum concentration 
      and area under the concentration-time curve increase sub-proportionally with 
      dose. Mean steady-state volume of distribution ranged from 127 to 385L. Sirolimus 
      was a major metabolite (metabolite-to-parent ratio range, 2.5 to 3.5). Whole 
      blood clearance was nonlinear, ranging from 19 to 51 L/h (34 to 220 mg/m(2)). 
      Variability predicted with flat doses appears comparable with data based on 
      body-surface area-normalized treatment. Partial responses were observed in one 
      patient with renal clear-cell carcinoma and in one patient with breast 
      adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: CCI-779 displayed no immunosuppressive effects with 
      manageable and reversible adverse events at doses up to 220 mg/m(2), the highest 
      dose tested. Based on our results, weekly doses of 25, 75, and 250 mg CCI-779 not 
      based on classical definitions of maximum-tolerated dose are being tested in 
      phase II trials in patients with breast and renal cancer.

TI  - Performance of the new mycophenolate assay based on IMPDH enzymatic activity for 
      pharmacokinetic investigations and setup of Bayesian estimators in different 
      populations of allograft recipients.
PG  - 443-50
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0b013e3181a8f0ae [doi]
AB  - A new mycophenolate (MPA) assay based on the enzymatic activity of recombinant 
      type II inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (the pharmacological target of MPA) 
      with excellent correlation with high-performance liquid chromatography has 
      recently been released for the measurement of MPA plasma levels. This study aimed 
      to (1) compare this new assay with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS) for MPA pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in different populations of 
      allograft recipients given mycophenolate mofetil, (2) develop specific Bayesian 
      estimators for this inhibition assay and test their accuracy, and (3) compare the 
      resulting MPA area under the curve (AUC0-12h) estimates with those of Bayesian 
      estimators developed based on the LC-MS/MS results. Sixty-four adult or 
      pediatric, renal or lung transplant patients who were administered mycophenolate 
      mofetil in association with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or sirolimus at different 
      post-transplant periods were enrolled as part of different PK studies. Eight 
      hundred ninety-four patients' samples were analyzed in parallel with the 
      enzymatic MPA assay and a reference LC-MS/MS method. Repeated analysis of quality 
      control samples showed a mean difference of 6% between the 2 assays, whereas the 
      results obtained in different populations of transplanted patients showed 
      excellent correlation (r2 > 0.96) and small mean relative differences 
      (2.0%-16.9%). The full profiles obtained with both assays were adequately fitted 
      using either a 2-compartment model with 1 "gamma" absorption phase or a 
      1-compartment model with 2 gamma inputs. Several PK parameters were significantly 
      affected by the analytical method used. Accurate Bayesian estimators could be 
      specifically developed for the enzymatic MPA assay, using the same 3 
      concentration-time points (20 minutes, 1 hour, and 3 hours post dose) as with 
      LC-MS/MS, with a median bias versus reference (trapezoidal) AUC0-12h values of 
      -1.3% (range -45.2% to 40.4%), and 83% of the patients within +/-20% of the 
      reference. These Bayesian estimates were significantly higher than those obtained 
      with LC-MS/MS in patients on cyclosporine or sirolimus, but not in patients on 
      tacrolimus.

TI  - Systemic exposure of sirolimus after coronary stent implantation in patients with 
      de novo coronary lesions: Supralimus-Core® pharmacokinetic study.
PG  - 273-9
LID - 10.1016/S0019-4832(12)60086-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to assess the systemic drug release and 
      distribution of sirolimus-eluting coronary stents. METHODS: Twenty patients with 
      coronary artery disease (CAD) were treated with 1, 2, or 3 a newly designed 
      metallic stents. Blood samples were drawn at 14 time points to determine the 
      pharmacokinetic of sirolimus. Whole blood concentrations of sirolimus were 
      determined by using a sensitive validated high-performance liquid chromatography 
      mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry method. RESULTS: Minimal measurable blood 
      levels were detectable at 7 days. Across all dose levels, individual T(max) 
      values ranged from 1.00 hour and 12.00 hours; individual C(max) ranged from 0.73 
      ng/mL and 4.13 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the limited exposure of the 
      systemic circulation of the eluted drug with the use of the Supralimus-Core® 
      Sirolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System (Sahajanand Medical Technologies Pvt. 
      Ltd., Surat, India). In this study, sirolimus concentration in systemic 
      circulation is to be safe, well-tolerated and short-lived.

TI  - Adding sirolimus to tacrolimus-based immunosuppression in pediatric renal 
      transplant recipients reduces tacrolimus exposure.
PG  - 2005-10
AB  - In adult renal recipients, coadministration of tacrolimus (TAC) and sirolimus 
      (SIR) results in reduced exposure to TAC at SIR doses of 2 mg/day. Eight 
      pediatric renal recipients (median age at transplant 2.0 years, range: 1.2-12.9 
      years) were converted to TAC- and SIR-based immunosuppression as a rescue 
      therapy. All patients had biopsy-proven chronic allograft nephropathy. TAC levels 
      were measured using a commercially available EMIT assay and SIR levels with a 
      newly developed assay based on the LC-MS MS technology. SIR was started at 
      0.13+/-0.05 mg/kg/day (3.51+/-1.26 mg/m2/day) in two divided doses. TAC was given 
      at 0.14+/-0.09 mg/kg/day, resulting in a trough level of 6.3+/-2.5 ng/mL. After 
      the addition of SIR, the median dose required to keep TAC blood trough 
      concentrations within the target range increased by 71.2% (range: 21.9-245.4%), 
      dose-normalized TAC exposure (AUC) decreased to 67.1% and the dose-normalized 
      C(max), a surrogate for absorption rate, to 53.8% (both geometric means) while 
      terminal half-life (t1/2), a pharmacokinetic parameter characterizing systemic 
      elimination, remained unchanged (p<0.93). Adding SIR to TAC-based 
      immunosuppression in young pediatric renal transplant recipients results in a 
      significant decrease of TAC exposure. TAC trough levels should be monitored 
      frequently.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of everolimus in de novo renal transplant patients: 
      impact of ethnicity and comedications.
PG  - 247-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Everolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant intended for acute 
      rejection prophylaxis after kidney transplantation. METHODS: A total of 5260 
      blood samples were collected in the context of two randomized, double-blind, 
      multicenter efficacy trials in 673 patients over a 6-month period after kidney 
      transplantation. The data were evaluated in a nonlinear mixed-effects model. The 
      influence of demographic characteristics (age, weight, sex, and ethnicity) and of 
      comedications on everolimus exposure was explored. RESULTS: For a reference 
      44-year-old, 71-kg Caucasian kidney allograft recipient receiving everolimus as 
      part of a cyclosporine (INN, ciclosporin)-prednisone immunosuppressive regimen, 
      the absorption rate constant was 6.07 h(-1) (standard error [SE], 0.70 h(-1)), 
      the apparent clearance was 8.8 L/h (SE, 0.2 L/h), and the apparent central 
      distribution volume was 110 L (SE, 5 L). There were no clinically relevant 
      influences of age, weight, or sex on clearance. No significant difference in 
      clearance was detected for Asian patients, whereas black patients had an average 
      clearance that was 20% higher than that of nonblack patients. Patients 
      concomitantly receiving erythromycin or azithromycin had an average 19% lower 
      clearance. One patient receiving itraconazole had a 74% reduction in clearance. 
      After we accounted for covariates, the remaining interindividual variability in 
      clearance was 27% and the variability for distribution volume was 36%. The 
      combined intraindividual and assay/measurement residual error in everolimus blood 
      concentrations was 31%. CONCLUSIONS: Dose adjustment of everolimus on the basis 
      of weight does not appear necessary. Black patients may need a higher dose to 
      achieve exposure that is similar to that of nonblack patients. Concomitant 
      administration of potent inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP3A may 
      reduce everolimus clearance and increase its blood concentrations.

PG  - 625-31
LID - 10.1111/j.1472-8206.2009.00699.x [doi]
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (pk) and drug 
      interactions between cyclosporine (CsA) and sirolimus (SRL) in kidney transplant 
      recipients. The morning (a.m.) and evening (p.m.) pk of CsA (4-5 mg/kg/dose) and 
      SRL (2 mg, n = 20; 5 mg, n = 33) were evaluated on day 7 (n = 53). CsA showed 
      circadian variation when comparing a.m. and p.m. administration [AUC: 8066 vs. 
      6699, P < 0.001 (CI 970.9; 1763.6); C0: 272 vs. 245, P = 0.007 (CI 7.5; 46.1)]. 
      SRL showed dose-proportional pk. Significant and drug-to-drug 
      concentration-dependent pk interactions were observed within a narrow 
      concentration range for both drugs. A fivefold increase in SRL AUC (from a mean 
      of 130 to 538 ng h/mL) was associated with a 25% increase in mean a.m. CsA AUC 
      [7021 to 8811 ng h/mL, P = 0.037, CI (-3461.2; -118.9)] and with a 42% increase 
      in mean p.m. CsA AUC [5386-7639, P = 0.024, CI (-4164.4; -340.7)]. A twofold 
      increase in a.m. CsA AUC (from 5860 to 10 974 ng h/mL) was associated with a 70% 
      increase in mean SRL AUC [223 to 380 ng h/mL, P = 0.0026, CI (-291.7; -22.8)]. A 
      twofold increase in p.m. CsA AUC (from 4573 to 9692 ng h/mL) was associated with 
      a 63% increase in mean SRL AUC [246 to 400 ng h/mL, P = 0.032, CI (-290.7; 
      -16.6)]. CSA shows circadian pk regardless of sirolimus dose or blood 
      concentration. Significant drug-to-drug interactions occur within narrow blood 
      drug concentrations. The magnitude of the effect of CsA on SRL blood 
      concentration is higher than that of SRL on CsA blood concentrations. These 
      findings emphasize the need for therapeutic drug monitoring using this drug 
      combination.

TI  - Weekly nab-Rapamycin in patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies: final 
      results of a phase I trial.
PG  - 5474-84
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3110 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This dose-finding phase I study investigated the maximum-tolerated dose 
      (MTD) and safety of weekly nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin (nab-rapamycin) 
      in patients with untreatable advanced nonhematologic malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL 
      DESIGN: nab-Rapamycin was administered weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of 
      rest, with a starting dose of 45 mg/m(2). Additional doses were 56.25, 100, 150, 
      and 125 mg/m(2). RESULTS: Of 27 enrolled patients, 26 were treated. Two 
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) occurred at 150 mg/m(2) [grade 3 aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST) elevation and grade 4 thrombocytopenia], and two DLTs 
      occurred at 125 mg/m(2) (grade 3 suicidal ideation and grade 3 hypophosphatemia). 
      Thus, the MTD was declared at 100 mg/m(2). Most treatment-related adverse events 
      (TRAE) were grade 1/2, including thrombocytopenia (58%), hypokalemia (23%), 
      mucositis (38%), fatigue (27%), rash (23%), diarrhea (23%), nausea (19%), anemia 
      (19%), hypophosphatemia (19%), neutropenia (15%), and hypertriglyceridemia (15%). 
      Only one grade 3 nonhematologic TRAE (dyspnea) and one grade 3 hematologic event 
      (anemia) occurred at the MTD. One patient with kidney cancer had a partial 
      response and 2 patients remained on study for 365 days (patient with 
      mesothelioma) and 238 days (patient with neuroendocrine tumor). The peak 
      concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 
      rapamycin increased with dose between 45 and 150 mg/m(2), except for a relatively 
      low AUC at 125 mg/m(2). nab-Rapamycin significantly inhibited mTOR targets S6K 
      and 4EBP1. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical dose of single-agent nab-rapamycin was 
      established at 100 mg/m(2) weekly (3 of 4 weeks) given intravenously, which was 
      well tolerated with preliminary evidence of response and stable disease, and 
      produced a fairly dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile in patients with 
      unresectable advanced nonhematologic malignancies.

TI  - A phase Ib combination study of RO4929097, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, and 
      temsirolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 1182-91
LID - 10.1007/s10637-013-0001-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and assess the 
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics of RO4929097in combination 
      with temsirolimus. METHODS: Escalating doses of RO4929097 and temsirolimus were 
      administered at three dose levels. Patients received once daily oral RO4929097 on 
      a 3 days on/4 days off schedule every week, and weekly intravenous temsirolimus. 
      Blood samples were collected for PK analysis. Archival tissue specimens were 
      collected for Notch pathway biomarker analysis and genotyping of frequent 
      oncogenic mutations. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with refractory advanced solid 
      tumors were enrolled in three dose levels (DLs): DL1 (RO4929097 10 mg; 
      Temsirolimus 25 mg), DL2 (RO4929097 20 mg; Temsirolimus 25 mg), and DL3 
      (RO4929097 20 mg; Temsirolimus 37.5 mg). The most common toxicities related to 
      the study drug combination included: fatigue (82 %; grade 3 6 %), mucositis, (71 
      %; grade 3 6 %), neutropenia (59 %; grade 3 12 %), anemia (59 %; grade 3 0 %), 
      and hypertriglyceridemia (59 %; grade 3 0 %). Two dose-limiting toxicities, grade 
      3 rash and grade 3 mucositis, were observed in the same patient in the first dose 
      level prompting dose expansion. Eleven patients (73 %) had stable disease as 
      their best response. Co-administration of RO4929097 was associated with increased 
      clearance and reduced exposure to temsirolimus, suggestive of drug-drug 
      interaction via CYP3A4 induction. No correlation between the expression of Notch 
      pathway biomarkers or genotype and time to progression was noted. CONCLUSIONS: 
      RO4929097 can be safely combined with temsirolimus in patients with advanced 
      solid tumors. The RP2D was established at 20 mg of RO4929097 combined with 37.5 
      mg of temsirolimus.

TI  - Everolimus in de novo cardiac transplantation: pharmacokinetics, therapeutic 
      range, and influence on cyclosporine exposure.
PG  - 1117-25
AB  - We evaluated exposure, safety, and efficacy data from an international Phase 3 
      trial of everolimus in de novo heart transplantation to characterize the 
      longitudinal pharmacokinetics of everolimus and cyclosporine and to identify a 
      therapeutic concentration range for everolimus. We randomized 634 patients to 
      receive either 0.75 mg everolimus twice daily, 1.5 mg everolimus twice daily, or 
      azathioprine in addition to corticosteroids and cyclosporine. At 8 visits during 
      the first 6 months after transplantation, we obtained 2,328 everolimus trough 
      levels (Cmin) and 129 area-under-the-curve (AUC) profiles over the dosing 
      interval in patients treated with everolimus; we collected 3,258 cyclosporine 
      trough concentrations and 174 profiles in all 3 treatment arms. We used 
      median-effect analysis to characterize exposure-response associations between 
      everolimus average Cmin vs freedom from biopsy-confirmed acute rejection; maximum 
      cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, triglyceride, and creatinine levels; and 
      minimum leukocyte and platelet counts. Everolimus Cmins averaged 5.2 +/- 3.8 
      ng/ml and 9.4 +/- 6.3 ng/ml at the lower and upper dose levels. A 17% 
      underproportionality was noted in Cmins; however, peak exposure and AUC were 
      consistent with dose proportionality. Everolimus exposure was stable during the 
      6-month period. Interindividual variability was 37% for AUC and 40% for Cmin. The 
      latter parameter was not influenced to a clinically relevant extent by sex, age, 
      or weight. The Cmin was well correlated with AUC (r2 = 0.81). Everolimus Cmin was 
      significantly related to freedom from rejection (p = 0.02) with 3 ng/ml being an 
      informative lower threshold for efficacy. Thrombocytopenia, defined as <75 x 
      10(9)/liter, was related significantly to Cmin (p = 0.03); however, the incidence 
      in this study was too low to establish an upper end for the therapeutic range. 
      Lower doses of cyclosporine (by 15% to 19%) were used in patients treated with 
      everolimus to achieve cyclosporine Cmins and AUCs similar to those in patients 
      treated with azathioprine. Everolimus exposure was dose proportional and stable 
      during the first 6 months after transplantation. Interindividual pharmacokinetic 
      variability was high but not influenced by common demographic covariates. We 
      observed a significantly increased risk of acute rejection at everolimus trough 
      levels <3 ng/ml, which constitutes the lower therapeutic concentration limit when 
      everolimus is used with conventionally dosed cyclosporine. Everolimus-related 
      adverse events were manageable up to the highest troughs (22 ng/ml) observed in 
      this population. We could not derive a precise upper therapeutic concentration 
      limit from these data.

TI  - Effect of multiple-dose erythromycin on everolimus pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 35-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to quantify the influence of the CYP3A inhibitor 
      erythromycin on the pharmacokinetics of everolimus, a CYP3A substrate. METHODS: 
      This was a two-period, single-sequence, crossover study in 16 healthy subjects. 
      In period 1, subjects received the reference treatment of a single 2-mg dose of 
      everolimus. In period 2, they received the test treatment of erythromycin 500 mg 
      three times daily for a total of 9 days and a single 2-mg dose of everolimus 
      coadministered on the fifth day of erythromycin therapy. The test/reference ratio 
      and 90% confidence interval (CI) were derived for everolimus C (max) and AUC. 
      RESULTS: During erythromycin coadministration, everolimus C (max) increased 
      2.0-fold (90% CI, 1.8-2.3) from 20+/-5 ng/ml to 40+/-10 ng/ml. Everolimus AUC 
      increased 4.4-fold (90% CI, 3.5-5.4) from 116+/-37 ng h/ml to 524+/-225 ng h/ml. 
      Everolimus half-life was prolonged by 39% from 32+/-6 h to 44+/-6 h. Erythromycin 
      predose concentrations were not changed after single-dose administration of 
      everolimus. CONCLUSION: Multiple-dose erythromycin increased single-dose 
      everolimus blood levels by an average 4.4-fold (range, 2.0-12.6). During 
      erythromycin treatment, a compensatory everolimus dose reduction should be made 
      guided by everolimus therapeutic drug monitoring.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and metabolic disposition of sirolimus in healthy male 
      volunteers after a single oral dose.
PG  - 51-61
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and metabolic disposition of sirolimus (rapamycin, 
      Rapamune), a macrocyclic immunosuppressive agent for the prevention of allograft 
      rejection in organ transplantation, were investigated in 6 healthy male 
      volunteers after a single nominal 40-mg oral dose of the C-radiolabeled drug, 
      with the added aim of assessing the potential role of sirolimus metabolites in 
      the clinical pharmacology of the parent drug. The absorption of parent drug and 
      derived materials was rapid (tmax 1.3 +/- 0.5 hours, mean +/- SD), and the 
      elimination of sirolimus was slow (t(1/2) 60 +/- 10 hours, mean +/- SD) in whole 
      blood. The high whole blood to plasma (B/P) concentration ratio of sirolimus (142 
      +/- 39) was consistent with its extensive partitioning into formed blood 
      elements. The markedly lower B/P value based on radioactivity (2.7 +/- 0.4) 
      suggested that drug-derived products partitioned into formed blood elements to a 
      much lesser extent. Based on AUC0-144h values, unchanged sirolimus represented an 
      average 35% of total radioactivity in whole blood. Drug-derived products in whole 
      blood were characterized by HPLC, LC/MS, and LC/MS/MS as 41-O-demethyl, 
      7-O-demethyl, and several hydroxy, dihydroxy, hydroxy-demethyl and didemethyl 
      sirolimus metabolites. The percentage distribution of sirolimus metabolites in 
      whole blood ranged from 3%-10% at 1 hour to 6%-17% at 24 hours after drug 
      administration. Based on their low immunosuppressive activities and relative 
      abundance in whole blood of humans after sirolimus administration, metabolites of 
      sirolimus do not appear to play a major role in the clinical pharmacology of the 
      parent drug. A majority of the administered radioactivity (91.0 +/- 8.0%) was 
      recovered from feces, and only 2.2% +/- 0.9% was renally excreted.

      pharmacokinetic characteristics over a wide dose range (from 1 to 60 mg/week). 
      The objective of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) 
      model to describe the nonlinearity of sirolimus. Whole blood concentration data, 
      obtained from four phase I clinical trials, were analyzed using a nonlinear 
      mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM) approach. The influence of potential covariates 
      was evaluated. Model robustness was assessed using nonparametric bootstrap and 
      visual predictive check approaches. The data were well described by a 
      two-compartment model incorporating a saturable Michaelis-Menten kinetic 
      absorption process. A covariate analysis identified hematocrit as influencing the 
      oral clearance of sirolimus. The visual predictive check indicated that the final 
      pharmacokinetic model adequately predicted observed concentrations. The 
      pharmacokinetics of sirolimus, based on whole blood concentrations, appears to be 
      nonlinear due to saturable absorption.CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology

TI  - Limited sampling models and Bayesian estimation for mycophenolic acid area under 
      the curve prediction in stable renal transplant patients co-medicated with 
      ciclosporin or sirolimus.
PG  - 745-58

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Mycophenolate mofetil is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid 
      (MPA), an immunosuppressive agent used in combination with corticosteroids and 
      calcineurin inhibitors or sirolimus for the prevention of acute rejection after 
      solid organ transplantation. Although MPA has a rather narrow therapeutic window 
      and its pharmacokinetics show considerable intra- and interindividual 
      variability, dosing guidelines recommend a standard dosage regimen of 0.5-1.0 g 
      twice daily in adult renal, liver and cardiac transplant recipients. The main 
      objective of the present study was to develop a method to predict the MPA area 
      under the plasma concentration-time curve during one 12-hour dosing interval 
      (AUC(12)) by using multiple linear regression models and maximum a posteriori 
      (MAP) Bayesian estimation methods in patients co-medicated with ciclosporin or 
      sirolimus, aiming to individualize the dosage regimen of mycophenolate mofetil. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pharmacokinetic profiles of MPA and mycophenolic acid 
      glucuronide (MPAG), the main metabolite of MPA, were obtained from 40 stable 
      adult renal allograft recipients on three different occasions: the day before 
      switching from ciclosporin to sirolimus co-medication (+/-7.4 months 
      post-transplantation; period I) and at 60 days and 270 days after the switch 
      (periods II and III). Blood samples for determination of MPA and MPAG 
      concentrations in plasma were taken at 0 hours (pre-dose) and at 0.33, 0.66, 
      1.25, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after oral intake of mycophenolate mofetil. The MPA 
      AUC(12) was calculated by the trapezoidal method (the observed AUC(12)). Patients 
      were randomly divided into (i) a model-building test group (n = 27); and (ii) a 
      model-validation group (n = 13). Multiple linear regression models were 
      developed, based on three sampling times after drug administration. Subsequently, 
      a population pharmacokinetic model describing MPA and MPAG plasma concentrations 
      was developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling and a Bayesian estimator 
      based on the population pharmacokinetic model was used to predict the MPA AUC(12) 
      based on three sampling times taken within 2 hours following dosing. RESULTS: 
      Fifty-two percent of the observed AUC(12) values (three periods) in the 40 
      patients receiving a fixed dose of mycophenolate mofetil 750 mg twice daily were 
      outside the recommended therapeutic range (30-60 microg x h/mL). The failure of 
      the standard dose to yield an AUC(12) value within the therapeutic range was 
      especially pronounced during the first study period. Of the multiple linear 
      regression models that were tested, the equation based on the 0-hour (pre-dose), 
      0.66- and 2-hour sampling times showed the best predictive performance in the 
      validation group: r2 = 0.79, relative root mean square error (rRMSE) = 14% and 
      mean relative prediction error (MRPE) = 0.9%. The pharmacokinetics of MPA and 
      MPAG were best described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption 
      and elimination for MPA, plus a compartment for MPAG, also including a 
      gastrointestinal compartment and enterohepatic cycling in the case of sirolimus 
      co-medication. The ratio of aminotransferase liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and the 
      glomerular filtration rate significantly influenced MPA glucuronidation and MPAG 
      renal excretion, respectively. Bayesian estimation of the MPA AUC(12) based on 
      0-, 1.25- and 2-hour sampling times predicted the observed AUC(12) values of the 
      patients in the validation group, with the following predictive performance 
      characteristics: r2 = 0.93, rRMSE = 12.4% and MRPE = -0.4%. CONCLUSION: Use of 
      the developed multiple linear regression equation and Bayesian estimator, both 
      based on only three blood sampling times within 2 hours following a dose of 
      mycophenolate mofetil, allowed an accurate prediction of a patient's MPA AUC(12) 
      for therapeutic drug monitoring and dose individualization. These findings should 
      be validated in a randomized prospective trial.

AB  - Nine subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grade C) and 9 healthy 
      matched control subjects were given a single 15-mg dose of sirolimus by oral 
      solution. Increases (P < or = .002) in mean whole-blood sirolimus t(1/2) (168%), 
      AUC(0-infinity) (210%), and MRT(oral) (261%), together with a decrease (P = .001) 
      in CL/F (-67%), were observed in subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared 
      with healthy matched controls. Sirolimus pharmacokinetic data in Child-Pugh grade 
      A (n = 13, mild) and B (n = 5, moderate) subjects from a previous identically 
      designed study were available for an inter-study comparison. Overall, mean 
      t(1/2), weight-normalized AUC, and MRT(oral) increased steadily, whereas mean 
      CL/F decreased steadily, with increasing degrees of hepatic impairment. CL/F 
      showed large intersubject variabilities within subject types and extensive 
      overlap among the subject types. The results of this study suggest that an 
      initial sirolimus dose reduction of approximately 60% is appropriate in patients 
      with acute severe hepatic impairment; this should be followed by further dose 
      adjustment, based on therapeutic drug monitoring, until the trough concentrations 
      have stabilized at sirolimus levels existing prior to the onset of acute liver 
      failure.

TI  - Kinetics and dynamics of single oral doses of sirolimus in sixteen renal 
      transplant recipients.
PG  - 397-406
AB  - Sirolimus is a new immunosuppressive drug that has been evaluated in animal 
      experiments. The current study was conducted on humans with reformulated 
      sirolimus in doses from 3 mg/m2 to 15 mg/m2. Sixteen renal transplant recipients 
      were included in this phase I study to determine the safety, tolerance, and 
      preliminary pharmacokinetics of increasing single doses of orally administered 
      sirolimus. All 16 patients had stable renal graft function after a renal 
      transplant at least 6 months before the study. Basal immunosuppression consisted 
      of cyclosporine and prednisolone (n = 10) or cyclosporine, azathioprine, and 
      prednisolone (n = 6). Four groups (I, 3 mg/m2; II, 5 mg/m2; III, 10 mg/m2; IV, 15 
      mg/m2) of four patients were assigned randomly to receive sirolimus (n = 3) or 
      placebo (n = 1). Among the 12 patients who received sirolimus, five had mild 
      transient study events such as headache, nausea, mild dizziness, hypoglycemia, 
      epistaxis, and decrease in platelets. No serious adverse events occurred and no 
      nephrotoxic effects could be related to the single dose administration of 
      sirolimus. The only study event that was judged as probably related to sirolimus 
      was the single case of thrombocytopenia. The other events were evaluated as 
      possibly related. Thrombocytopenia occurred at the highest dose level (15 mg/m2 
      sirolimus). In two of the patients in the placebo group, slight elevations of 
      liver enzymes and serum amylase were seen. Blood and plasma sirolimus 
      concentrations were analyzed by an electrospray-high performance liquid/mass 
      spectrophotometric (ESP-HPLC/MS) method Sirolimus showed an extensive red blood 
      cell distribution with a mean blood/ plasma ratio of 49.1. The elimination 
      half-life ranged from 43.8 to 86.5 hours (mean 56.9 hours). The Cmax and the area 
      under the concentration versus time curves (AUC) correlated reasonably with doses 
      from 3 to 15 mg/m2. The oral dose clearance ranged from 42 to 339 ml/h.kg. No 
      clinically significant differences were seen in the trough concentrations of 
      cyclosporine or the AUCs before and after the administration of sirolimus. 
      Administration of single oral doses of sirolimus from 3 to 15 mg/m2 was safe and 
      well tolerated in stable renal transplant recipients. Thrombocytopenia may be the 
      dose-limiting toxicity. Additional phase II and phase III clinical trials will 
      define the immunosuppressive efficacy of sirolimus.

TI  - Circadian pharmacokinetics and limited sampling strategy of everolimus in heart 
      transplant patients .
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.5414/CP202668 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate circadian changes in everolimus (EVL) pharmacokinetics and 
      to identify the time point of blood sampling with the strongest correlation with 
      the area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC) of EVL in heart 
      transplant patients. METHODS: Heart transplant patients receiving the same dose 
      of EVL twice a day were reviewed. In 28 patients enrolled, whole blood samples 
      were collected before (C0), and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after each 
      administration of EVL. Blood concentrations of EVL were compared between active 
      (9:00 AM to 9:00 PM) and resting periods (9:00 PM to 9:00 AM). RESULTS: AUC0-4h, 
      peak concentration (Cmax), Cmax/minimum concentration, and peak-trough 
      fluctuation in the resting period were significantly lower than those in the 
      active period (p = 0.008, 0.017, 0.022, and 0.011, respectively). Half-life and 
      mean residence time were significantly longer in the resting period than in the 
      active period (p = 0.002 and 0.002, respectively). AUC0-12h in the active period 
      was similar (p = 0.154) and correlated with that in the resting period 
      (r(2) = 0.93). Two-point blood samplings, C0 and C2, correlated more strongly 
      with AUC0-12h for EVL, compared with C0 alone (0.92 vs. 0.79, respectively, for 
      r(2) in the active period). CONCLUSIONS: EVL pharmacokinetics showed circadian 
      changes, suggesting delayed absorption and decreased metabolic activity at rest. 
      However, the circadian changes did not affect AUC0-12h. A 2-time-point model that 
      included C0 and C2 was more accurate for predicting the AUC0-12h of EVL than C0 
      alone in heart transplant patients. .

TI  - Influence of co-medication with sirolimus or cyclosporine on mycophenolic acid 
      pharmacokinetics in kidney transplantation.
PG  - 2937-44
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid (MPA)--the active metabolite of 
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)--is significantly influenced by co-medications. The 
      impact of sirolimus on daily MPA exposure, however, has not been investigated so 
      far. As a part of the study aimed at investigating the efficacy of Campath-1H 
      induction therapy in a steroid-free regimen in kidney transplantation, MPA plasma 
      levels were serially measured in 21 patients treated with low-dose sirolimus 
      (SRL) or low-dose CsA both in addition to low-dose MMF over 12 months 
      post-operatively. Full pharmacokinetic profiles were compared at month 6 and 12 
      post-surgery. Mean dose-adjusted MPA trough levels were 4.4-fold higher in 
      patients on combined SRL and MMF than in those given CsA and MMF. Pharmacokinetic 
      studies demonstrated that mean MPA C(max) and T(max) were comparable in the two 
      groups, while mean MPA AUC(0-12) was higher in SRL than CsA treated patients. The 
      pharmacokinetic profile of SRL- but not of CsA-group showed a second peak 
      consistent with the enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. These findings suggest 
      that SRL and CsA have different effects on MPA metabolism and/or excretion 
      eventually affecting its immunosuppressive property and/or toxicity. CsA, but not 
      SRL, inhibits MPA enterohepatic recirculation, reducing MPA daily exposure.

TI  - Phase 1 study of dalotuzumab monotherapy and ridaforolimus-dalotuzumab 
      combination therapy in paediatric patients with advanced solid tumours.

AB  - AIM: Dalotuzumab is a highly specific, humanised immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal 
      antibody against insulin-like growth factor receptor 1. This multicenter phase 1 
      study (NCT01431547) explored the safety and pharmacokinetics of dalotuzumab 
      monotherapy (part 1) and the combination of dalotuzumab with the mammalian target 
      of rapamycin inhibitor ridaforolimus (part 2) in paediatric patients with 
      advanced solid tumours. METHODS: Dalotuzumab was administered intravenously every 
      3 weeks starting at 900 mg/m(2) and escalating to 1200 and 1500 mg/m(2). 
      Combination therapy included intravenous dalotuzumab at the defined single-agent 
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and oral ridaforolimus 28 mg/m(2) daily (days 
      1-5), repeated weekly. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed to evaluate the 
      mean serum trough dalotuzumab concentration, which guided the RP2D. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-four patients were enrolled (part 1, n = 20; part 2, n = 4). No 
      dose-limiting toxicities were observed in patients receiving dalotuzumab alone. 
      One patient experienced dose-limiting stomatitis in the combination arm. 
      Pharmacokinetic data showed dose-dependent increases in exposure (area under the 
      curve from zero to infinity [AUC0-∞]) (87,900, 164,000, and 186,000 h*mg/ml for 
      the 900, 1200, and 1500 mg/m(2) dose levels, respectively), maximum serum 
      concentration (Cmax) (392, 643, and 870 mg/ml), and serum trough concentration 
      (Ctrough) (67.1, 71.6, and 101 mg/ml). The mean half-life was 265, 394, and 
      310 h, respectively. Dalotuzumab pharmacokinetics were not affected by 
      coadministration with ridaforolimus. One of six patients with Ewing sarcoma had 
      confirmed partial response to dalotuzumab monotherapy at 900 mg/m(2). Time to 
      response was 41 d, and progression occurred at 126 d. CONCLUSION: Dalotuzumab was 
      well tolerated in paediatric patients with advanced solid malignancies. The RP2D 
      of dalotuzumab is 900 mg/m(2) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01431547, 
      Protocol PN062).

TI  - Mycophenolate mofetil in islet cell transplant: variable pharmacokinetics but 
      good correlation between total and unbound concentrations.
PG  - 901-9
AB  - The authors investigated the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid over 1 year in 
      8 Caucasian women undergoing islet cell transplantation. Total mycophenolic acid 
      AUC(0-12) mcg x h/mL before day 60 was 62.1-67.8, declining to 33.6-64.7 
      thereafter (P = .61). Median total trough concentrations were 1.16-2.90 mcg/mL. 
      Unbound AUC(0-12) was 412-673 ng x h/mL and did not change over time (P = .30). 
      Median percent unbound mycophenolic acid was 0.95% of total concentrations. 
      Individual unbound and total mycophenolic acid concentrations were highly 
      correlated (r2 = 0.94). Total mycophenolic acid trough concentration and total 
      AUC(0-12) were modestly correlated (r2 = 0.65). Intra- and interpatient 
      variability of systemic mycophenolic acid exposure was high. Six patients 
      required dose reductions prior to day 60 due to adverse effects. All subjects 
      achieved insulin independence; 3 later lost graft function. The trend toward 
      higher exposure in the early periods followed by dose reductions suggests that 
      lower initial doses and therapeutic drug monitoring may be necessary.

TI  - Everolimus in combination with cyclosporin a as pre- and posttransplantation 
      immunosuppressive therapy in nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
      transplantation.
PG  - 1061-8
LID - 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.12.522 [doi]
AB  - Everolimus (RAD001) is an mTOR inhibitor that has been successfully used as an 
      immunosuppressant in solid-organ transplantation. Data in allogeneic 
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is limited. This study aimed to 
      investigate pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of RAD001 in a canine 
      allogeneic HSCT model. First, pharmacokinetics of RAD001 were performed in 
      healthy dogs in order to determine the appropriate dosing. Doses of 0.25 mg 
      RAD001 twice daily in combination with 15 mg/kg cyclosporin A (CsA) twice daily 
      were identified as appropriate starting doses to achieve the targeted range of 
      RAD001 (3-8 μg/L) when orally administered. Subsequently, 10 dogs were 
      transplanted using 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) for conditioning and 0.25 mg 
      RAD001 twice daily plus 15 mg/kg CsA twice daily for pre- and posttransplantation 
      immunosuppression. Seven of the 10 transplanted dogs were maintained at the 
      starting RAD001 dose throughout the study. For the remaining 3 dogs, dose 
      adjustments were necessary. RAD001 accumulation over time did not occur. All dogs 
      initially engrafted. Five dogs eventually rejected the graft (weeks 10, 10, 13, 
      27, and 56). Two dogs died of pneumonia (weeks 8 and 72) but were chimeric until 
      then. Total cholesterol rose from median 4.1 mmol/L (3.5-5.7 mmol/L) before HSCT 
      to 6.0 mmol/l (5.0-8.5 mmol/l) at day 21 after HSCT, but remained always within 
      normal range. Changes in creatinine and triglyceride values were not observed. 
      Long-term engraftment rates were inferior to sirolimus/CsA and mycophenolate 
      mofetil (MMF)/CsA regimen, respectively. RAD001/CsA caused a more pronounced 
      reduction of platelet counts to median 2 × 10(9)/L (range: 0-21 × 10(9)/L) and 
      longer time to platelet recovery of 21 days (range: 14-24 days) compared with 
      MMF/CsA. CsA c(2h) levels were significantly enhanced in the RAD001/CsA regimen, 
      but c(0h) and area under the curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC(0-12h)) values did not 
      differ compared with an MMF/CsA immunosuppression. In summary, immunosuppression 
      consisting of RAD001 and CsA is well tolerated but not as efficient as with other 
      established immunosuppressants in a canine nonmyeloablative HSCT regimen. Hence, 
      our study does not support the application of RAD001/CsA as standard practice in 
      this setting.

      transplantation has been performed successfully in selected HIV-positive 
      recipients with CD4 and an HIV viral load response to highly active 
      antiretroviral therapy. In these patients, an interaction between a protease 
      inhibitor (nelfinavir) and tacrolimus has been shown. The effect of nelfinavir on 
      the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus, a newer immunosuppressive drug, is currently 
      not known. The goal of the present case report is to document the interaction 
      between sirolimus and nelfinavir in a liver transplantation patient. A 
      40-year-old woman who was HIV positive underwent a cadaveric liver 
      transplantation for acute fulminant liver failure secondary to nevirapine (a 
      nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor). Postoperatively, she was treated 
      with tacrolimus and steroids. She experienced steroid-resistant rejection and was 
      started on sirolimus on the 17th postoperative day. Kinetic parameters were 
      determined after a 2-mg oral dose of sirolimus and 250 mg of nelfinavir by 
      collecting multiple peripheral venous blood samples before and after sirolimus 
      administration. The kinetic parameters were compared with parameters from three 
      liver transplantation patients on sirolimus who were not on nelfinavir. After 
      normalizing the kinetic parameters to sirolimus dose of 1 mg/d, 0-hour and 
      24-hour trough sirolimus concentrations were nine-fold and five-fold higher for 
      the patient who was on nelfinavir, compared with those who were not on 
      nelfinavir. The maximum concentration was 3.2 times higher, the area under the 
      concentration curve was 1.6 times higher, and the terminal disposition half-life 
      was prolonged by 60%. The time to reach the peak concentration was 1 hour in all 
      patients. Increase in trough concentration, peak concentration area under the 
      curve concentration, and prolongation of half-life of sirolimus has been shown in 
      a patient who was on a low dose (one fifth the recommended dose) of nelfinavir.

TI  - Tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics of ridaforolimus in combination with

      prostate cancer (CRPC).
PG  - 909-16
LID - 10.1007/s00280-013-2250-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Recent data indicate that there is a significant cross-talk between the 
      PI3K/Akt/mTOR and androgen receptor signaling pathways. We evaluated safety and 
      tolerability as well as potential drug-drug interaction of ridaforolimus, a 
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, when combined with the androgen 
      receptor inhibitor bicalutamide in patients with asymptomatic, metastatic 
      castration-resistant prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were treated 
      with the combination of ridaforolimus 30 mg/day for 5 consecutive days each week 
      and bicalutamide 50 mg/day. Ridaforolimus pharmacokinetics was assessed with and 
      without bicalutamide. RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled including 1 screen 
      failure. Dose reductions were required in 7 patients. Three of the 11 patients 
      experienced a dose-limited toxicity, 1 with Grade 3 hyperglycemia and 2 with 
      Grade 2 stomatitis leading to <75 % of planned ridaforolimus dose during the 
      first 35 days of study treatment. The pharmacokinetic results showed no 
      differences in exposures to ridaforolimus with and without concomitant 
      bicalutamide administration. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no evidence of a 
      clinically relevant pharmacological drug-drug interaction, the occurrence of 
      dose-limiting toxicities in 3 of 11 evaluable patients at a reduced dose of 
      ridaforolimus of 30 mg/day suggests that this combination may not be well suited 
      for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic prostate cancer patients.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Optimization of Everolimus Dosing in Oncology: A Randomized 
      Crossover Trial.
PG  - 637-644
LID - 10.1007/s40262-017-0582-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus is used 
      in the treatment of breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, and renal cancer. The 
      approved 10 mg once-daily dose is associated with considerable adverse effects 
      and it has been suggested that these are associated with the maximum 
      concentration (C (max)) of everolimus. Twice-daily dosing might be an alternative 
      strategy with improved tolerability; however, a direct pharmacokinetic comparison 
      of 10 mg once-daily with 5 mg twice-daily dosing is lacking. METHODS: We 
      performed a prospective, randomized, pharmacokinetic, crossover trial comparing 
      everolimus 10 mg once daily with 5 mg twice daily. Patients received the first 
      dose schedule for 2 weeks and then switched to the alternative regimen for 
      2 weeks. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed on days 14 and 28. RESULTS: 
      Eleven patients were included in the study, of whom 10 were evaluable for 
      pharmacokinetic analysis. On the 10 mg once-daily schedule, C (max), minimum 
      concentration (C (min)), and area under the concentration-time curve from time 
      zero to 24 h (AUC(24)) were 61.5 ng/mL [mean percentage coefficient of variation 
      (CV%) 29.6], 9.6 ng/mL (CV% 35.0), and 435 ng h/mL (CV% 28.1), respectively. 
      Switching to the 5 mg twice-daily schedule resulted in a reduction of C (max) to 
      40.3 ng/mL (CV% 46.6) (p = 0.013), while maintaining AUC(24) at 436 ng h/mL 
      (CV% 34.8) (p = 0.952). C (min) increased to 13.7 ng/mL (CV% 53.9) (p = 0.018). 
      The overall reduction in C (max) was 21.2 ng/mL, or 32.7%. The C (max)/C (min) 
      ratio was reduced from 6.44 (CV% 36.2) to 3.18 (CV% 35.5) (p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that switching from a once-daily to a twice-daily 
      everolimus dose schedule reduces C (max) without negatively impacting C (min) or 
      AUC(24). These results merit further investigation of the twice-daily schedule in 
      an effort to reduce everolimus toxicity while maintaining treatment efficacy. 
      REGISTRATION: This trial was registered in the EurdaCT database (2014-004833-25) 
      and the Netherlands Trial Registry (NTR4908).

AB  - PURPOSE: Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) progressing after endocrine therapy 
      frequently activates PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The BOLERO-2 trial showed that 
      everolimus-exemestane achieves increased progression free survival (PFS) compared 
      with exemestane. However, there is great inter-patient variability in toxicity 
      and response to exemestane-everolimus treatment. The objective of this study was 
      to perform an exploratory study analyzing the implication of single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) on outcomes from this treatment through a pharmacogenetic 
      analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood was collected from 90 postmenopausal women 
      with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative MBC treated with 
      exemestane-everolimus following progression after prior treatment with a 
      non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. Everolimus pharmacokinetics was measured in 37 
      patients. Twelve SNPs in genes involved in everolimus pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics were genotyped and associations assessed with drug plasma 
      levels, clinically relevant toxicities (non-infectious pneumonitis, mucositis, 
      hyperglycemia and hematological toxicities), dose reductions or treatment 
      suspensions due to toxicity, progression free survival (PFS) and overall 
      survival. RESULTS: We found that CYP3A4 rs35599367 variant (CYP3A4*22 allele) 
      carriers had higher everolimus blood concentration compared to wild type patients 
      (P = 0.019). ABCB1 rs1045642 was associated with risk of mucositis (P = 0.031), 
      while PIK3R1 rs10515074 and RAPTOR rs9906827 were associated with hyperglycemia 
      and non-infectious pneumonitis (P = 0.016 and 0.024, respectively). Furthermore, 
      RAPTOR rs9906827 was associated with PFS (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: CYP3A4*22 
      allele influenced plasma concentration of everolimus and several SNPs in 
      PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway genes were associated with treatment toxicities and 
      prognosis. These results require replication, but suggest that germline variation 
      could influence everolimus outcomes in MBC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical data are lacking concerning therapeutic action and systemic 
      exposure of tacrolimus (TAC) and everolimus (EVL) in a combined regimen in renal 
      transplantation. METHODS: A prospective randomized phase II pharmacokinetic study 
      was conducted comparing two fixed EVL dosages (0.75 mg two times per day (BID), 
      group A, or 1.5 mg BID, group B) in combination with standard TAC dose. Complete 
      12-hr pharmacokinetic curves of both drugs were performed at days 4, 14, and 42 
      posttransplant. RESULTS: A higher TAC Cmin was observed with EVL dose of 0.75 mg 
      BID (TAC 11.1+/-6.4 group A vs. 9.4+/-5.0 ng/mL group B, P=0.03), with equivalent 
      TAC area under the curves (162+/-61 vs. 171+/-75). The exposure to TAC was lower 
      in group B despite higher TAC doses were required to maintain target 
      concentrations (day 14: 9.5 vs. 12.5 mg and day 42: 6 vs. 9 mg, P<0.05). 
      Cmin-TAC/dose and area under the curve-TAC/dose ratios were significantly lower, 
      from day 4 to day 42, in group B. Both groups achieved good graft function and 
      acute rejection rate was similar (20% and 15%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We 
      conclude that in adult renal transplant recipients, EVL significantly decreases 
      TAC oral bioavailability in a dose-dependent manner. Doses higher than 1.5 mg BID 
      would be probably needed for TAC-minimization strategies because 3 mg/day is not 
      enough to achieve levels more than 3 ng/mL during the first 2 weeks. Therapeutic 
      drug monitoring is mandatory to adjust the dose and prevent low TAC exposure. 
      This regimen of low EVL exposure plus standard TAC exposure avoids wound healing 
      problems with good efficacy.

PG  - 83-4
AB  - Species differences in the in vitro stability of sirolimus was assessed in plasma 
      and whole blood in relation to red blood cell distribution. Fresh blood and 
      plasma samples obtained from humans, rabbits, and rats were aliquoted and spiked 
      with sirolimus. After incubation from 0 to 144 hr in a shaking water bath 
      maintained at 37 degrees C, sirolimus concentrations were quantified by a 
      specific high-liquid performance chromatographic method. Sirolimus was unstable 
      in both plasma and whole blood. Sirolimus degradation half-life in whole blood 
      was 135 hr (vs. 7.2 hr in plasma) in humans, 62 hr (vs. 3.1 hr) in rabbits, and 
      15 hr (vs. 2.2 hr) in rats. Sirolimus stability is greater in whole blood 
      compared with plasma in proportion to the whole blood/plasma ratio and 
      hematocrit. In vivo instability may account for up to 36% of sirolimus clearance 
      in humans and 13% in rabbits, and this is an important factor in the 
      pharmacokinetics of this drug.

TI  - A Phase I Study of Cixutumumab (IMC-A12) in Combination with Temsirolimus 
      (CCI-779) in Children with Recurrent Solid Tumors: A Children's Oncology Group 
      Phase I Consortium Report.
PG  - 1558-65

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the MTD, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), pharmacokinetics, 
      and biologic effects of cixutumumab administered in combination with temsirolimus 
      to children with refractory solid tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cixutumumab and 
      temsirolimus were administered intravenously once every 7 days in 28-day cycles. 
      Pharmacokinetic and biology studies, including assessment of mTOR downstream 
      targets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, were performed during the first 
      cycle. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients, median age 11.8 years (range, 1-21.5), with 
      recurrent solid or central nervous system tumors were enrolled, of whom 33 were 
      fully assessable for toxicity. There were four dose levels, which included two 
      dose reductions and a subsequent intermediated dose escalation: (i) IMC-A12 6 
      mg/kg, temsirolimus 15 mg/m(2); (ii) IMC-A12 6 mg/kg, temsirolimus 10 mg/m(2); 
      (iii) IMC-A12 4 mg/kg, temsirolimus 8 mg/m(2); and (iv) IMC-A12 6 mg/kg, 
      temsirolimus 8 mg/m(2). Mucositis was the predominant DLT. Other DLTs included 
      hypercholesterolemia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and increased alanine 
      aminotransferase. Target inhibition (decreased S6K1 and PAkt) in peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells was noted at all dose levels. Marked interpatient variability 
      in temsirolimus pharmacokinetic parameters was noted. At 8 mg/m(2), the median 
      temsirolimus AUC was 2,946 ng • h/mL (range, 937-5,536) with a median sirolimus 
      AUC of 767 ng • h/mL (range, 245-3,675). CONCLUSIONS: The recommended pediatric 
      phase II doses for the combination of cixutumumab and temsirolimus are 6 mg/kg 
      and 8 mg/m(2), respectively.

TI  - A clinical pharmacokinetic study of tacrolimus and sirolimus combination 
      immunosuppression comparing simultaneous to separated administration.
PG  - 346-50
AB  - The pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between tacrolimus (TAC) and sirolimus 
      (SRL), similarly structured immunosuppressive compounds that share binding 
      proteins, is unknown. The combination of SRL with cyclosporin (CsA) has been 
      studied, and a 4-hour interval between dosing of the two drugs is recommended 
      even though it is inconvenient for patients and may affect compliance. 
      Twenty-five liver and kidney-pancreas transplant recipients treated with a 
      combination of SRL and low-dose TAC completed full PK studies while being treated 
      with 4-hour interval dosing (ID) and then with simultaneous dosing. Whole blood 
      was sampled for immunoassay measurement of TAC and SRL levels. Blood 
      concentration/dose ratios of SRL and TAC varied between patients by a factor of 8 
      and 5, respectively, but correlation between trough concentration levels (C(0)) 
      and drug exposure area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was excellent 
      (TAC: r(2) = 0.82; SRL: r(2) = 0.83). Neither PK profiles of SRL nor those of TAC 
      were altered by simultaneous administration. Dose-corrected AUC and C0 of TAC 
      correlated with SRL (r(2) = 0.8 and 0.8, respectively). Bone marrow suppression 
      and nephrotoxicity were not enhanced nor were any new toxicities observed when 
      TAC and SRL were used in combination. These data confirm that simultaneous dosing 
      of TAC and SRL after transplantation is safe and that trough level monitoring is 
      adequate to control therapy.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of CCI-779: correlations to safety and 
      pharmacogenomic responses in patients with advanced renal cancer.
PG  - 76-89
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
      CCI-779 and its metabolite, sirolimus, and evaluate associations of exposure 
      parameters with safety and clinical activity. Exposure parameters were also 
      correlated with pharmacogenomic responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMCs). METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial, 
      once-weekly intravenous doses of 25, 75, or 250 mg CCI-779 were administered to 
      patients with advanced renal cancer. Whole blood for CCI-779 and sirolimus 
      concentrations was drawn. Population pharmacokinetic analyses yielded 
      Bayesian-predicted exposure metrics that were correlated with severity and 
      duration of adverse events and survival. PBMC samples taken before and after 
      treatment were examined for pharmacogenomic responses. Ribonucleic acid samples 
      were converted to labeled probes and hybridized to oligonucleotide arrays 
      containing more than 12,600 human sequences. RESULTS: The final population 
      pharmacokinetic models of CCI-779 and sirolimus included 235 and 305 
      observations, respectively, from 50 patients. For CCI-779, dose, single versus 
      multiple dose, and body surface area were significant pharmacokinetic covariates. 
      For sirolimus, dose and hematocrit were significant covariates. Age, sex, or race 
      did not influence drug disposition. CCI-779 area under the curve correlated with 
      adverse event severity for thrombocytopenia (P = .007), pruritus (P = .011), and 
      hyperlipemia (P = .040). Exposure (CCI-779 cumulative area under the curve) 
      correlated with a specific subset of gene transcripts in PBMCs following 16 weeks 
      after therapy (P < .001, Spearman correlation). CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of 
      CCI-779 and sirolimus were adequately described with a population model 
      incorporating factors for dose, attenuated exposure of multiple doses, body 
      surface area, and hematocrit. Correlations with adverse event severity and 
      duration profiles were provided to aid in the detection of treatment-emergent 
      effects. Pharmacogenomic profiling of PBMCs identified altered ribonucleic acid 
      transcript expression levels that correlate with exposure. These transcripts 
      represent potential biomarkers of CCI-779 exposure in peripheral blood.

      A9 per 1 mm of stent. A non-randomized multicenter trial was conducted in Japan. 
      Twenty-two de novo lesions were treated by Nobori stents and biolimus A9 
      concentration in whole blood was serially measured at 14 predetermined time 
      points using a validated chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
      assay. The C max was 85.3 ± 37.9 pg/mL (min-max 46.7-169 pg/mL) in the 18 mm 
      cohort and 198 ± 81 pg/mL (min-max 82.5-365 pg/mL) in the ≥ 28 mm cohort and no 
      early or late bursts of biolimus A9 release were documented. After 4 weeks, no 
      measurable concentration of biolimus A9 was observed in any patient. Estimated 
      AUC0-t was 1.12 ± 1.16 ng/mL h in the 18 mm group, and 5.93 ± 4.41 ng/mL h for 
      the ≥ 28 mm group. A significant association between loaded biolimus A9 dose 
      adjusted by patient weight and pharmacokinetic parameters was observed. The 
      systemic exposure of biolimus A9 eluting from the Nobori stent was low and 
      proportional to the loaded amount of biolimus A9, and clearance from the blood 
      was rapid. These findings suggest that the Nobori stent is feasible and safe. 
      Systemic lower exposure of biolimus A9 after Nobori stent implantation may have 
      beneficial effects on stent endothelialization.

LID - 10.1038/bjc.2014.370 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted a phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumours 
      to identify the recommended dose, assess pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamic 
      activity and preclinical antitumour efficacy of the combination of sirolimus and 
      gemcitabine. METHODS: Nineteen patients were treated with sirolimus 2 or 5 mg 
      daily and gemcitabine 800 or 1000 mg m(-2) on days 1 and 8. Dose escalation 
      depended on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate during the first 3-week period. 
      Paired skin biopsies were evaluated for phosphorylated S6 (pS6) as marker of mTOR 
      (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibition. Pharmacokinetics and preclinical 
      evaluation of efficacy using two different sarcoma cell lines and leiomyosarcoma 
      xenografts were also conducted. RESULTS: Three DLTs were observed: grade 3 
      transaminitis, grade 3 thrombocytopenia and grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Common 
      treatment-related adverse events included anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia 
      and transaminitis. Pharmacodynamic analyses demonstrated mTOR inhibition with 
      sirolimus 5 mg and PK showed no influence of sirolimus concentrations on 
      gemcitabine clearance. In vitro and in vivo studies suggested mTOR pathway 
      hyperactivation by gemcitabine that was reversed by sirolimus. Tumour growth in 
      leiomyosarcoma xenografts was dramatically inhibited by the treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Recommended dose was sirolimus 5 mg per 24 h plus gemcitabine 
      800 mg m(-2). Antitumour activity in preclinical sarcoma models and mTOR 
      signalling inhibition were observed. A phase II study is currently ongoing.

TI  - Systemic exposure of everolimus after stent implantation: a pharmacokinetic 
      study.
PG  - 751.e1-7
LID - 10.1016/j.ahj.2008.07.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the pharmacokinetics of the eluted everolimus by 
      assessing systemic drug release and distribution of everolimus-eluting stents. 
      BACKGROUND: Drugs eluted by a coronary stent might cause adverse events such as 
      tumors, infections, or noncardiac death. The systemic exposure of the drugs is 
      unknown because there are only limited data about pharmacokinetics of 
      drug-eluting stents in humans. METHODS: Venous blood samples in a subset of 39 
      patients were drawn just before implantation of the first stent (baseline, 
      0-minute time point) and at 10 and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 
      168, and 720 hours (30 days) after completion of implantation of the last stent. 
      Whole blood concentrations of everolimus were determined using a sensitive 
      validated high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass 
      spectrometry method. RESULTS: The total dose of everolimus received by the 
      patients ranged from 53 to 588 microg. The last time point up to which whole 
      blood concentrations could be quantified ranged per patient from 4 to 720 hours 
      after implantation of the last stent. Across all dose levels, individual T(max) 
      values ranged from 0.13 and 2.17 hours; individual C(max) ranged from 0.14 to 
      2.79 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the limited exposure to the systemic 
      circulation of the eluted drug with the use of the XIENCE V Everolimus-Eluting 
      Coronary Stent System (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA). Therefore, a systemic 
      cause of adverse events is unlikely.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of sirolimus.
PG  - 31-5
AB  - Sirolimus (rapamycin, Rapamune) is a potent immunosuppressive drug that received 
      marketing approval from the US Food and Drug Administration on September 15, 
      1999. Research into defining its pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior, interaction with 
      other agents, and metabolism is ongoing. It has been established that oral doses 
      of both liquid and solid formulation are rapidly, though incompletely and 
      variably, absorbed. Metabolism by the intestinal and hepatic CYP3A family of 
      enzymes likely contributes to variability in absorption and low bioavailability. 
      Sirolimus has a long terminal half-life, the AUC correlates well with trough and 
      peak concentrations, and it exhibits a moderate degree of dose proportionality. 
      There is significant interpatient variability in PK parameters of sirolimus, 
      though it exhibits predictable PK behavior when used with prednisone and 
      cyclosporine neoral. There is a decreased rejection risk with higher doses and 
      target level attainment. Several species of sirolimus metabolites have been 
      characterized, and are measurable in whole blood and tissue specimens. Many more 
      species of sirolimus metabolites are detectable, but they are not quantifiable at 
      this time. The total concentration of metabolites appears to be less than that of 
      the parent drug when examined through the PK profile. A reference method for the 
      quantitation of metabolites remains elusive because of a lack of proper 
      standardization. The clinical significance of sirolimus metabolites remains to be 
      proven.

TI  - Differentiation of innovator versus generic cyclosporine via a drug interaction 
      on sirolimus.
PG  - 361-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Both sirolimus and cyclosporine are immunosuppressants used in a 
      combined regimen after organ transplantation. When coadministered with the 
      innovator formulation of cyclosporine, sirolimus blood levels increase 3.3-fold 
      due to a pharmacokinetic interaction. We assessed this drug interaction for 
      potential differences when the innovator formulation is replaced by a generic 
      cyclosporine. METHODS: In this randomized single-dose crossover study, 28 healthy 
      subjects received 5 mg sirolimus oral solution with 250 mg cyclosporine soft 
      gelatin capsules given as the innovator formulation (reference treatment) versus 
      a generic formulation (test treatment). Sirolimus peak blood concentration (Cmax) 
      and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were compared between test and 
      reference treatments by standard bioequivalence testing. RESULTS: Sirolimus Cmax 
      was significantly lower by 17% in the presence of generic versus innovator 
      cyclosporine (p=0.0003) and failed bioequivalence criteria with a test/reference 
      ratio of 0.83 (90% confidence interval, 0.77-0.90). Nearly half of the subjects 
      (46%) had sirolimus Cmax changes which fell outside the bioequivalence window 
      with individual Cmax decreases up to 52% and increases up to 39%. Sirolimus AUC 
      was significantly lower by 11% in the presence of generic versus innovator 
      cyclosporine (p=0.041) but satisfied average bioequivalence criteria with a 
      test/reference ratio of 0.89 (0.83-0.95). Nonetheless, over a third of the 
      subjects (43%) had sirolimus AUC changes outside the standard bioequivalence 
      window with individual AUC decreases up to 39% and increases up to 42%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Switching between innovator and generic cyclosporine may have a 
      clinically-relevant impact on coadministered sirolimus pharmacokinetics. If such 
      a switch is initiated by the prescriber, follow-up therapeutic monitoring of both 
      cyclosporine and sirolimus blood levels should be performed to guide dose 
      adjustments as necessary. If the switch is made without consulting the 
      prescriber, potentially significant changes in sirolimus exposure could go 
      unnoticed by the clinician and patient.

TI  - Phase I/IIa trial of the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor ridaforolimus 
      (AP23573; MK-8669) administered orally in patients with refractory or advanced 
      malignancies and sarcoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ridaforolimus is an inhibitor of mTOR with evidence of antitumor 
      activity in an I.V. formulation. This multicenter, open-label, 3 + 3 design 
      nonrandomized, dose-escalation, phase I/IIa trial was conducted to determine the 
      safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic parameters, maximum tolerated 
      dose, and antitumor activity of oral ridaforolimus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors refractory to therapy were 
      eligible. Seven different continuous and intermittent dosing regimens were 
      examined. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-seven patients were enrolled in this 
      study among which 85 were patients with sarcoma. Stomatitis was the most common 
      DLT observed. The dosing regimen, 40 mg QD × 5 days/week, provided the best 
      combination of cumulative dose, dose density, and cumulative exposure, and was 
      the recommended dosing regimen for subsequent clinical development. PK was 
      nonlinear, with less than proportional increases in day-1 blood AUC0-∞ and Cmax, 
      particularly with doses >40 mg. The terminal half-life estimate of ridaforolimus 
      (QD × 5 40 mg) was 42.0 h, and the mean half-life ∼30-60 h. The clinical benefit 
      rate, (complete response, partial response, or stable disease for ≥4 months was 
      24.5% for all patients and 27.1% for patients with sarcoma. CONCLUSION: Oral 
      ridaforolimus had an acceptable safety profile and exhibited antitumor activity 
      in patients with sarcoma and other malignancies. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier 
      NCT00112372.

TI  - Immunosuppressive TOR kinase inhibitor everolimus (RAD) suppresses growth of 
      cells derived from posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder at 
      allograft-protecting doses.
PG  - 1710-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) represent a 
      life-threatening complication of standard immunosuppressive therapy. The impact 
      of novel, rapamycin-related immunosuppressive drugs on the pathogenesis of PTLDs 
      remains undefined. METHODS: We tested the effect of everolimus (RAD, Novartis 
      Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) on human PTLD-derived cells using in vitro assays 
      and an in vivo severe combined immunodeficiency disease mouse xenotransplant 
      model. RESULTS: Everolimus profoundly inhibited the proliferation, cell-cycle 
      progression, and survival of the PTLD-1 cell line established from a pulmonary 
      PTLD. Equally profound inhibition of PTLD-1 growth was achieved in vivo at 
      well-tolerated everolimus doses of 0.5 to 5 mg/kg per day. Five mg/kg per day of 
      everolimus, given once per day, inhibited PTLD-1 tumor volume gain by more than 
      10-fold in treated mice compared with untreated mice. Because the subsequent 
      pharmacokinetic analysis indicated rapid everolimus absorption, distribution, and 
      clearance in mice (with a half-life of 3 to 6 hr and maximum drug blood 
      concentration reached after 0.5 to 1 hr), treatment was changed to a twice-daily 
      regimen. Everolimus given twice daily at 0.5 mg/kg per dose inhibited 
      tumor-volume gain by more than 60-fold and at 0.25 mg/kg per dose by more than 
      10-fold. Similar everolimus doses were required to prevent graft rejection in a 
      mouse heart allotransplantation model; the highest dose tested (1.5 mg/kg twice 
      daily) resulted in long-term graft survival in all mice that underwent 
      transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus displays a potent inhibitory effect on 
      PTLD-derived cells in vitro and in vivo in a dose range leading to prevention of 
      allograft rejection and may prove effective in both the prevention and treatment 
      of PTLDs in transplant patients.

TI  - Comparison of pharmacokinetics of the sirolimus-eluting stent in Japanese 
      patients with those in American patients.
PG  - 468-73
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the 
      sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implanted in 20 Japanese patients with angina 
      pectoris and compare it with that in US study. Bx VELOCITY stent loaded with a 
      total sirolimus dose of 150 mug was used in this study. Ten patients were treated 
      by single-SES (group 1) and 10 patients were treated by double-SES (group 2). 
      Sirolimus levels in whole blood were serially measured in the 2 groups after the 
      SES implantation and compared with the pharmacokinetics in US study. We also 
      evaluated the side effect of sirolimus, major adverse clinical events, and binary 
      angiographic restenosis at 8 months after the SES implantation. Peak 
      concentrations were observed approximately 4 hours after the SES implantation, 
      and sirolimus half-lives were approximately 120 hours in each group. Mean peak 
      sirolimus levels were 0.86 and 2.00 ng/mL for the group 1 and group 2, 
      respectively. The peak concentrations of sirolimus in this study were twice 
      higher in Japanese than in Americans, but they were much lower than effective 
      concentration of sirolimus when orally administrated as an immunosuppressive 
      agent. There were no side effects of sirolimus and no binary angiographic 
      restenosis in any patients. One patient had target vessel revascularization at 8 
      months after the SES implantation. Although blood concentrations of sirolimus in 
      Japanese patients after SES implantation are somewhat higher than those in 
      American patients, its level is extremely low compared with the systemic 
      administration, indicating the same clinical benefits by the SES could be safely 
      expected in Japanese patients.

TI  - Tolerability and steady-state pharmacokinetics of everolimus in maintenance renal 
      transplant patients.
PG  - 2606-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current immunosuppressant regimens need to be improved to prevent 
      acute and chronic graft rejection. The novel macrocyclic immunosuppressant 
      everolimus (Certican, RAD) is currently in clinical development to address this 
      issue. METHODS: The primary objective of this multicentre, randomized, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating phase 1 study was to evaluate 
      the safety and tolerability of everolimus at four dose levels (0.75, 2.5, 5 and 
      10 mg/day) in maintenance renal transplant patients receiving cyclosporin and 
      steroids. The secondary objective was to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of 
      two different formulations (capsule and tablet) of everolimus. RESULTS: 
      Fifty-four subjects were randomized for 4 weeks treatment with everolimus (n = 
      44) or placebo (n = 10). Dose levels of everolimus between 0.75 and 5 mg daily 
      were well tolerated, permitting dose escalation to the highest everolimus dose of 
      10 mg daily. At this dose, everolimus was associated with a higher incidence and 
      severity of adverse events, most notably thrombocytopenia. Pharmacodynamic 
      assessment showed a relationship between drug exposure and thrombocytopenia. 
      Notable reversible elevations of cholesterol were also observed at the 10 mg/day 
      dose. Other changes in laboratory evaluations, including triglycerides, were 
      minor, reversible and did not appear to be dose dependent. The bioavailability of 
      the tablet formulation was 2.6-fold higher compared with the capsule, with 
      evidence for dose proportionality over the dose range tested. Within-subject 
      pharmacokinetic variability was low (coefficient of variation: 10-19%); however, 
      between-subject variability ranged from 34 to 60% for AUC and C(max). 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that up to 5 mg/day everolimus results in a 
      dose-proportional exposure, and is adequately well tolerated in renal transplant 
      recipients receiving cyclosporin and steroids.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Preclinical studies have demonstrated the additive effect of 
      rapamycin with bevacizumab for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment. We conducted a 
      Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of the combination in 
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: Adult participants with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma received intravenous bevacizumab (5mg/kg every 14 days) 
      and oral rapamycin (1-6 mg/day; 3+3 dose escalation design). Computed tomography 
      assessed tumour response and treatment safety. Pharmacokinetics assessment 
      established rapamycin blood concentrations pre- and post-dose. Dynamic 
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography analysed the tumour region for blood flow, 
      permeability surface area product, fractional intravascular blood volume and 
      extracellular-extravascular volume. RESULTS: Twenty-four participants were 
      treated. There were two dose limiting toxicities with rapamycin 5mg: grade 3 
      thrombocytopenia and grade 3 mucositis. The maximally tolerated dose of rapamycin 
      was 4 mg. Adverse events (grade 1-2) included hyperglycaemia (83%), 
      thrombocytopenia (75%), fatigue (46%), mucositis (46%), anorexia (42%), diarrhoea 
      (33%) and proteinuria (12.5%). Of 20 evaluable participants, one reached complete 
      response that lasted 4.5 months, two reached partial response, 14 reached stable 
      disease and three had progressive disease. Median overall survival was 9.4 
      months; progression-free survival was 5.5 months. Dose level and steady state 
      area under the concentration time curve for hour zero to infinity of rapamycin 
      correlated inversely with blood flow rate and change in permeability-surface 
      area. After 22 days of treatment, there were significant reductions from baseline 
      in blood flow rate, permeability-surface area and fractional intracellular blood 
      volume. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended Phase 2 dose of rapamycin is 4 mg in 
      combination with bevacizumab. Evidence of anti-vascular activity was observed 
      together with promising clinical activity.

TI  - The pharmacokinetics of Biolimus A9 after elution from the Nobori stent in 
      patients with coronary artery disease: the NOBORI PK study.
PG  - 901-8

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and 
      tolerability of Biolimus A9 eluted from Nobori coronary stents. BACKGROUND: : The 
      release kinetics and pharmacokinetics of drugs delivered via coronary stents have 
      been shown to play an essential role in the efficacy and safety of drug eluting 
      stents. METHODS: Twenty patients with coronary artery disease were treated with 
      single 14-mm (10 patients) or 28-mm long stent (10 patients). Blood samples were 
      drawn at 16 time points to determine the pharmacokinetics of Biolimus A9. At 
      seven time points, complete laboratory and toxicology panels were assessed to 
      screen for potential Biolimus A9 toxicity. The primary endpoint of the study was 
      the systemic blood concentrations of Biolimus A9 after 28 days and 6 months as 
      measured using highly specific and sensitive liquid chromatography- tandem mass 
      spectrometry assay. RESULTS: At 28 days, 6 patients (30%) had quantifiable 
      Biolimus A9 concentrations in blood. The highest Biolimus A9 blood concentration 
      measured in any sample was 32.2 pg/mL. The median time to maximum concentration 
      was 2 hr, ranging from 0.05 hr to 3 months. Six months after stent implantation, 
      only 1 of 20 patients had measurable Biolimus A9 concentrations at the lowest 
      level of quantification, while at 9 months no sample had quantifiable Biolimus A9 
      concentrations. Laboratory and toxicology assessments did not indicate any impact 
      of Biolimus A9 on the evaluated parameters. CONCLUSION: Results of this study 
      suggest that systemic exposure to Biolimus A9 was very low and that Biolimus A9 
      was well tolerated.

TI  - Phase I trial of oral mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with trastuzumab 
      and vinorelbine in pre-treated patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic 
      breast cancer.

AB  - To determine the feasible dose and schedule for everolimus, an oral mTOR 
      inhibitor, combined with vinorelbine and trastuzumab for patients with 
      HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer pretreated with trastuzumab. In this 
      phase Ib multicenter, Bayesian dose-escalation study, 50 patients received 
      everolimus 5 mg/day, 20 mg/week, or 30 mg/week plus vinorelbine (25 mg/m² on day 
      1 and 8 every 3 weeks) and trastuzumab (2 mg/kg weekly). Endpoints included 
      end-of-cycle-1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate (primary endpoint), safety, 
      relative dose intensity, overall response rate (ORR), and pharmacokinetics. Grade 
      3/4 neutropenia was the most common end-of-cycle-1 DLT and occurred in 10 of 30 
      and 4 of 14 patients in the 5 mg/day and 30 mg/week cohorts, respectively. Other 
      end-of-cycle-1 DLTs included single cases of febrile neutropenia, grade 3 
      stomatitis with concomitant fatigue, grade 2 stomatitis, grade 3 anorexia, and 
      grade 2 acneiform dermatitis, all in the 5-mg/day cohort. Based on the recorded 
      DLTs and global safety, everolimus 5 mg/day and 30 mg/week were chosen as the 
      optimal dose levels for the daily and weekly arms. Forty-seven patients were 
      evaluable for efficacy. ORR was 19.1%, with a disease control rate of 83.0% and 
      median progression-free survival of 30.7 weeks. No drug interaction was observed 
      between everolimus and vinorelbine. Everolimus combined with weekly vinorelbine 
      and trastuzumab generally was well tolerated and had encouraging antitumor 
      activity in heavily pretreated patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic 
      breast cancer that progressed on trastuzumab (NCT00426530).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vorolanib (X-82, CM082) is a multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor. 
      This study aimed to evaluate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and 
      antitumor activities of vorolanib plus everolimus (an inhibitor of mammalian 
      target of rapamycin). METHODS: Patients had histologically or cytologically 
      confirmed advanced RCC and failed with standard therapy were eligible for this 
      study. Dose-escalated combinations of vorolanib (100, 150 or 200 mg once daily) 
      with everolimus (5 mg once daily) were administered on 28-day cycles until 
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity using a conventional 3 + 3 
      dose-escalation design. FINDINGS: 22 patients (100 mg n = 4, 150 mg n = 3, 200 mg 
      n = 15) were enrolled. Only one patient experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT, 
      grade 4 thrombocytopenia) in the vorolanib 200 mg combination cohort, and the 
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. The most common treatment-related 
      adverse events were proteinuria (100%), leukopenia (77%), hypercholesterolaemia 
      (77%), increased low-density lipoprotein (68%), hypertriglyceridaemia (64%), 
      hyperglycaemia (59%), and fatigue (55%). Most treatment-related adverse events 
      were grade 1 to 2, with grade 3 or higher toxicities mostly seen in the 200 mg 
      cohort. Single dosing of vorolanib demonstrated dose-proportional increases in 
      the C(max) and AUC, and observed short t(1/2z) ranging from 4.74±1.44 to 
      12.89±7.49 h. The pharmacokinetic parameters for everolimus were similar among 
      all cohorts. Of 19 evaluable patients, the ORR and DCR was 32% (n = 6, 95% CI, 
      13-57%) and 100% (95% CI, 82-100%), respectively. INTERPRETATION: Combination 
      therapy of vorolanib 200 mg plus everolimus 5 mg once daily is potentially 
      effective with potential activity. Further evaluation of the combination in 
      advanced RCC patients is ongoing (NCT03095040). FUNDING: Betta Pharmaceutical

AB  - A rapid, sensitive method of detecting sirolimus in blood was developed and 
      applied in pharmacokinetic studies employing deionized water for hemolysis and a 
      weakly basic mobile phase to enhance chromatographic peak intensity. Dog blood 
      samples were processed via liquid-liquid extraction and the amounts of sirolimus 
      and tacrolimus, an internal standard, were quantified by LC-MS/MS. Specificity, 
      the lower limit of quantification, linearity, accuracy, precision, dilution, 
      recovery, matrix effects, robustness and stability were within the acceptable 
      range for assay validation. The concentration of sirolimus was quantifiable in 
      blood samples for up to 36 h after the dog had received a 3 mg/kg dose of 
      sirolimus. These observations suggest that sirolimus can be detected at low 
      levels in dog blood using a basic mobile phase and metal-free hemolysis. This 
      method is therefore applicable to pharmacokinetic studies in dogs.

TI  - A Phase Ib Study of the Dual PI3K/mTOR Inhibitor Dactolisib (BEZ235) Combined 
      with Everolimus in Patients with Advanced Solid Malignancies.
PG  - 323-332
LID - 10.1007/s11523-017-0482-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of everolimus and the imidazoquinoline derivative, 
      BEZ235 (dactolisib), a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, demonstrated synergy in a 
      preclinical model. OBJECTIVE: To establish clinical feasibility, a phase Ib 
      dose-escalation trial investigating safety and pharmacokinetics of this 
      combination in patients with advanced tumors was performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      BEZ235 was orally administered daily in escalating doses of 200, 400, and 800 mg 
      along with everolimus at 2.5 mg daily in 28-day cycles. Nineteen patients were 
      enrolled. Adverse events and tumor responses were evaluated using CTCAE v4.0 and 
      RECIST 1.1, respectively. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed. RESULTS: 
      Common toxicities observed included fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis, and 
      elevated liver enzymes. No confirmed responses were observed. BEZ235 
      pharmacokinetics exhibited dose-proportional increases in C(max) and AUC(0-24) 
      over the three doses, with high inter-individual variability. Non-compartmental 
      and population pharmacokinetic-based simulations indicated significant increases 
      in everolimus C(max) and AUC(0-24) on day 28 and decreased clearance to 
      13.41 L/hr. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of BEZ235 and everolimus demonstrated 
      limited efficacy and tolerance. BEZ235 systemic exposure increased in a 
      dose-proportional manner while oral bioavailability was quite low, which may be 
      related to gastrointestinal-specific toxicity. The changes in steady-state 
      pharmacokinetics of everolimus with BEZ235 highlight potential drug-drug 
      interactions when these two drugs are administered together. Clinicaltrials.gov: 
      NCT01508104.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interactions Between Letermovir and the 
      Immunosuppressants Cyclosporine, Tacrolimus, Sirolimus, and Mycophenolate 
      Mofetil.
PG  - 1331-1339
LID - 10.1002/jcph.1423 [doi]
AB  - Letermovir (AIC246, MK-8228) is a human cytomegalovirus terminase inhibitor 
      indicated for the prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus infection and disease in 
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients that is also being 
      investigated for use in other transplant settings. Many transplant patients 
      receive immunosuppressant drugs, of which several have narrow therapeutic ranges. 
      There is a potential for the coadministration of letermovir with these agents, 
      and any potential effect on their pharmacokinetics (PK) must be understood. Five 
      phase 1 trials were conducted in 73 healthy female participants to evaluate the 
      effect of letermovir on the PK of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, and 
      mycophenolic acid (active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]), as well as 
      the effect of cyclosporine and MMF on letermovir PK. Safety and tolerability were 
      also assessed. Coadministration of letermovir with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and 
      sirolimus resulted in 1.7-, 2.4-, and 3.4-fold increases in area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve and 1.1-, 1.6-, and 2.8-fold increases in maximum plasma 
      concentration, respectively, of the immunosuppressants. Coadministration of 
      letermovir and MMF had no meaningful effect on the PK of mycophenolic acid. 
      Coadministration with cyclosporine increased letermovir area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve by 2.1-fold and maximum plasma concentration by 
      1.5-fold, while coadministration with MMF did not meaningfully affect the PK of 
      letermovir. Given the increased exposures of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and 
      sirolimus, frequent monitoring of concentrations should be performed during 
      administration and at discontinuation of letermovir, with dose adjustment as 
      needed. These data support the reduction in clinical dosage of letermovir (to 
      240 mg) upon coadministration with cyclosporine.

TI  - Correlation between pretransplantation test dose cyclosporine pharmacokinetic 
      profiles and posttransplantation sirolimus blood levels in renal transplant 
      recipients.
PG  - 44-9
AB  - We sought to determine whether pretransplantation test dose pharmacokinetic 
      measurements of cyclosporine (CsA) concentrations would forecast the 
      posttransplantation blood concentrations of sirolimus in renal transplant 
      patients treated de novo with CsA, sirolimus, and prednisone. All 44 renal 
      transplant recipients enrolled in Phase I/II studies of de novo 
      posttransplantation therapy with sirolimus, CsA, and prednisone underwent 
      pretransplantation pharmacokinetic profiling after having received paired 
      intravenous (i.v.) and oral test doses of CsA. After transplantation, all 
      patients were treated with CsA on a once- or twice-daily schedule (according to a 
      concentration-controlled regimen), with tapering doses of prednisone, and with 
      fixed doses of sirolimus on a once-daily schedule. Patients were divided into 
      four cohorts based on the deviation of their pretransplantation CsA clearance or 
      bioavailability values from the mean. Patients with high pretransplantation CsA 
      clearance rates displayed a significantly lower mean posttransplantation value of 
      sirolimus trough concentrations than patients with low pretransplantation CsA 
      clearance rates. In contrast, values for pretransplantation absolute oral CsA 
      bioavailability failed to correlate with the mean posttransplantation 
      concentration of sirolimus but did predict posttransplantation CsA 
      bioavailability. Therefore, pretransplantation CsA clearance rate estimates may 
      forecast posttransplantation sirolimus concentrations, possibly guiding use of 
      sirolimus therapy to achieve an optimal ratio of concentration-dependent 
      immunosuppressive versus toxic effects.

TI  - A phase I study of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and temsirolimus in patients 
      with refractory solid malignancies.
PG  - 419-26
LID - 10.1007/s00280-014-2493-x [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to determine the maximum-tolerated dose and dose-limiting 
      toxicities of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in combination with 
      temsirolimus (T) in patients with refractory solid tumors. Using a standard "3+3" 
      dose escalation design, 23 patients were enrolled in three dosing cohorts in this 
      phase I study. The starting dose level was PLD at 30 mg/m(2) every 4 weeks and T 
      at 20 mg weekly. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of doxorubicin were evaluated for patients 
      in the expansion cohort. The most common treatment-related adverse events of all 
      grades were mucositis/stomatitis (69.6%), anorexia (52.2%), thrombocytopenia 
      (52.2%), and fatigue (47.8%). The recommended doses of this combination for phase 
      II studies are 25 mg/m(2) PLD and 25 mg T. PK analyses suggested increased 
      exposure of doxorubicin in this combination regimen compared to doxorubicin 
      administered as a single agent, possibly due to PK drug interactions. Out of 18 
      patients evaluable for a treatment response, two had partial responses (PR) 
      (breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma) and six had stable disease (SD). Two 
      patients remained on treatment for more than 1 year. The combination of PLD and T 
      is tolerable, and the treatment resulted in clinical benefit. The combination 
      regimen should be further explored in appropriate tumor types.

AB  - The safety of the coadministration of sunitinib with tacrolimus and everolimus 
      with regard to therapeutic drug monitoring has not been demonstrated. Here, we 
      report a patient who showed high sunitinib concentrations, in addition to 
      pharmacokinetic changes in tacrolimus and everolimus after sunitinib therapy. A 
      living-donor renal transplant patient treated with tacrolimus and everolimus was 
      diagnosed with pulmonary and pleural metastases of renal cell carcinoma. The 
      patient received sunitinib therapy (37.5 mg/day, 2 weeks on and 1 week off). This 
      patient exhibited a high total sunitinib concentration (sunitinib, 105.8 ng/mL; 
      N-desethyl sunitinib, 27.9 ng/mL) on day 10 postinitiation and experienced grade 
      3 diarrhea. The observed sunitinib concentrations were a little higher than those 
      reported in the 421C>A polymorphism of the ATP-binding cassette subfamily G 
      member 2 gene carrier. The observed concentrations of both tacrolimus and 
      everolimus gradually decreased compared with the Bayesian-predicted values after 
      the onset of sunitinib therapy, and the doses of tacrolimus and everolimus were 
      increased. Careful therapeutic drug monitoring of sunitinib, tacrolimus, and 
      everolimus concentrations is necessary during combination therapy, especially 
      after episodes of diarrhea.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid, tacrolimus and sirolimus after gastric 
      bypass surgery in end-stage renal disease and transplant patients: a pilot study.
PG  - 281-91
LID - 10.1111/j.1399-0012.2007.00783.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Promising data regarding the safety and efficacy of gastric bypass 
      surgery (GBS) as an option to address obesity in the transplant population are 
      emerging. The data lack on how GBS may alter the pharmacokinetics (PK) of modern 
      immunosuppression. The objective of this study was to describe the alterations in 
      the PK of modern immunosuppressants and the GBS population. METHODS: Data are 
      presented on six subjects who participated in this trial--four were on dialysis 
      and two were renal transplant recipients. Dialysis-dependent bypass subjects 
      received a single dose of 6 mg of sirolimus, two 4-mg doses of tacrolimus and two 
      1000-mg doses of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) over the 24-h study period. 
      Transplant recipients continued their current regimen. Maximum plasma 
      concentration (C(max)), time to reach the maximum plasma concentration (T(max)) 
      and the area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC(0-12) and 
      AUC(0-infinity) where appropriate) were calculated for tacrolimus, sirolimus, 
      mycophenolic acid (MPA) and mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG). RESULTS: 
      Significant inter-patient variability in the C(max), T(max) and AUC of 
      tacrolimus, sirolimus MPA and MPAG was observed. A notable difference in the 
      AUC:dose ratio for tacrolimus was seen when comparing data with published data in 
      the non-bypass population. Similar differences in PK were seen with sirolimus, 
      MPA and MPAG. CONCLUSIONS: When comparing the PK of sirolimus, tacrolimus, MPA 
      and MPAG to published PK data in the non-bypass population, significant 
      differences are observed. It is likely that transplant recipients with GBS would 
      need higher doses of tacrolimus, sirolimus and MMF to provide similar exposure to 
      a non-bypass patient.

TI  - A phase I study of a 4-week course of SDZ-RAD (RAD) quiescent 
      cyclosporine-prednisone-treated renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 1100-6
AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHODS: This phase I, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled 
      study assessed the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of a 4-week course of 
      once-daily, sequential ascending doses (0.75, 2.5, or 7.5 mg/day) of SDZ-RAD 
      (RAD) capsules in renal transplant recipients on a stable regimen of cyclosporine 
      (CsA; Neoral) and prednisone. RESULTS: RAD displayed a similar spectrum of side 
      effects as observed with rapamycin, namely, an increased incidence of infection 
      associated with the augmented immunosuppression and a dose-related occurrence of 
      thrombocytopenia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia, particularly at 
      the 7.5-mg dose. The pharmacokinetic parameters of RAD showed dose 
      proportionality, a good correlation between trough and area under the curve (AUC) 
      concentrations, and a moderate accumulation of 2.5-fold. The drug was absorbed 
      within 2 hr and displayed a 16-19-hr half-life, which is shorter than that of 
      rapamycin. RAD reached steady state at 4 days. Preliminary kinetic-dynamic 
      correlations indicate a correlation between thrombocytopenia (but not 
      hyperlipidemia) and AUC, as well as maximum drug concentrations, and 
      weight-adjusted dose. At the end of a 4-week course of simultaneous dosing, there 
      was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between CsA and RAD. CONCLUSION: 
      This study suggests that the shorter half-life of RAD compared to rapamycin may 
      confer the benefits of rapid attainment of steady state and dissipation of 
      effects upon drug cessation. Controlled, multicenter trials are being planned to 
      assess the impact of these features on clinical outcomes.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic sub-study in the SPIRIT III Randomized and Controlled Trial of 
      XIENCE V everolimus eluting coronary stent system.
PG  - 26-32
LID - 10.1111/j.1540-8183.2009.00517.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-eluting stents (DES) are widely used for treatment of coronary 
      artery disease with benefit of reduced restenosis compared to bare metal stents. 
      The XIENCE VEverolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System is a second-generation DES 
      system for better deliverability while maintaining safety and efficacy profiles. 
      The present pharmacokinetic sub-study from the SPIRIT III Randomized and 
      Controlled Trial (RCT) was to evaluate systemic exposure of patients to 
      everolimus and to further demonstrate safety following implantation of XIENCE 
      Vstents with everolimus doses ranging from 53 to 181 microg. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      Drug concentrations in whole blood were determined at multiple time points using 
      a validated analytical method with a limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL. 
      Individual C(max) ranged from 0.17 to 2.40 ng/mL and occurred between 0.07 and 
      1.88 hours across all dose levels. Both mean and individual C(max) values were 
      below the trough blood concentrations of everolimus (Certican) for inhibition of 
      organ transplant rejection. The last time point at which drug concentrations 
      could be quantified ranged from 12 to 168 hours postimplantation in individual 
      patients. In most cases, the blood levels dropped below the limit of 
      quantification after 72 hours. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that the XIENCE 
      Vstent causes a limited and systemic exposure to everolimus. The presumed 
      localized and efficient delivery of everolimus to target vessels coupled with 
      limited and transient systemic drug exposure contributes to the safety and 
      effectiveness of the XIENCE VEECSS in patients of SPIRIT III RCT for longer than 
      2 years.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of the four 
      limus-eluting stents used in Japanese patients. BACKGROUND: There are presently 
      no reports comparing human pharmacokinetics among drug-eluting stents (DESs). 
      METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from pharmacokinetic studies of 
      patients implanted with an 18-mm DES: Cypher stent (sirolimus, n = 10), Endeavor 
      stent (zotarolimus, n = 7), Xience V stent (everolimus, n = 6), and Nobori stent 
      (biolimus A9, n = 10), in multicenter trials of Japan. Total drug doses of the 
      Cypher stent, Endeavor stent, Xience V stent, and Nobori stent were 150, 180, 88, 
      and 293 μg, respectively. Drug concentrations were measured in serial whole blood 
      samples after implantation and the pharmacokinetics were analyzed. RESULTS: Mean 
      peak drug levels were 0.86 ng mL(-1) for Cypher, 1.80 ng mL(-1) for Endeavor, 
      0.50 ng mL(-1) for Xience V, and 0.09 ng mL(-1) for Nobori. After adjustment for 
      the loaded dose, mean peak drug levels of the Cypher and Xience V stents were 
      similar (0.0057 ng mL(-1) μg(-1) each) while the Endeavor (0.0100 ng mL(-1) 
      μg(-1)) was higher, and the Nobori (0.0003 ng mL(-1) μg(-1)) was lower, compared 
      with the Cypher and Xience V stents. The other pharmacokinetic parameters of four 
      DESs differed according to characteristics of the coated drug. The systemic 
      exposure of biolimus A9 was much lower than that of the other DESs studied. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients, systemic exposure was low, regardless of the 
      type of limus drug eluted from the stents; but specific pharmacokinetic 
      activities were varied according to the drug characteristics, concentration, and 
      DES design.

LID - 10.1038/ki.2013.517 [doi]
AB  - Several factors contribute to mycophenolic acid (MPA) between-patient 
      variability. Here we characterize the metabolic pathways of MPA and quantify the 
      effect of combining genetic polymorphism of multidrug-resistant-associated 
      protein-2, demographics, biochemical covariates, co-medication (cyclosporine 
      (CsA) vs. macrolides), and renal function on MPA, 7-O-MPA-glucuronide (MPAG), and 
      acyl-glucuronide (AcMPAG) disposition, in renal transplant recipients, after 
      mycophenolate mofetil. Complete pharmacokinetic profiles from 56 patients (five 
      occasions) were analyzed. Enterohepatic circulation was modeled by transport of 
      MPAG to the absorption site. This transport significantly decreased with 
      increasing CsA trough concentrations (CtroughCsA). MPAG and AcMPAG plasma 
      clearances significantly decreased with renal function. No significant influence 
      of multidrug-resistant-associated protein-2 C24T single-nucleotide polymorphism 
      was found. The model adequately predicted the increase in MPAG/AcMPAG exposures 
      in CsA and macrolide patients with decreased renal function. This resulted in 
      higher MPA exposures in macrolide patients versus CsA patients, and increased MPA 
      exposures with renal function from 25 to 10 ml/min, in macrolide patients, owing 
      to enhanced MPAG enterohepatic circulation. Lower-percentage enterohepatic 
      circulation occurred with higher CtroughCsA and renal function values. The lack 
      of MPA protein-binding modeling did not permit evaluation of the impact of renal 
      function and CtroughCsA on MPA exposures in CsA patients. Thus, dose tailoring of 
      covariates is recommended for target MPA exposure.

TI  - A phase 1 study of weekly everolimus (RAD001) in combination with docetaxel in 
      patients with metastatic breast cancer.
PG  - 2378-84
LID - 10.1002/cncr.26571 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin with everolimus may 
      improve the efficacy of taxanes. Everolimus and docetaxel are both metabolized by 
      CYP3A4, which could result in a pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction. METHODS: 
      Fifteen patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with docetaxel (doses 
      of 40-75 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle) in combination with 
      everolimus (doses ranging from 20 to 50 mg orally on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day 
      cycle) in a phase 1 trial using the continuous reassessment method to determine 
      maximum tolerated dose. The first 2 patients developed a dose-limiting toxicity 
      (neutropenic infection), prompting a mandatory dose reduction and PK evaluation 
      of both everolimus and docetaxel for patients enrolled in subsequent dosing 
      cohorts. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were treated. Dose-limiting toxicity included 
      grade 3 mucositis (n = 1), prolonged grade 4 neutropenia (n = 1), and grade 3 
      infection/febrile neutropenia (n = 3). Day 8 of everolimus was commonly held for 
      neutropenia despite a dose reduction in docetaxel to 40 mg/m(2). Eleven patients 
      underwent complete PK evaluation for everolimus, and 9 patients underwent 
      complete PK evaluation for both everolimus and docetaxel. Widely variable changes 
      in clearance were seen for both drugs, and the study was terminated because of 
      lack of efficacy and concerns regarding toxicity seen with the combination. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Weekly everolimus in combination with docetaxel every 3 weeks was 
      associated with excessive neutropenia and variable clearance of both drugs, 
      making combination therapy unpredictable, even at low doses of both drugs.

TI  - Tolerability and pharmacokinetics of intravitreal sirolimus.
PG  - 507-14
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and tolerability of a proprietary 
      sirolimus depot-forming ocular formulation in rabbits and humans after a single 
      intravitreal (i.v.t.) injection. METHODS: New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits were 
      intravitreally injected in both eyes with an injectable formulation in 5 (3 PK 
      and 2 tolerability) studies. The rabbits received up to approximately 220 μg 
      sirolimus per eye. At the desired timing post-injection, the animals were 
      euthanized; both eyes were enucleated, frozen, and dissected to separate sclera, 
      retina/choroid, and vitreous humor (VH). Whole blood (WB) samples were obtained 
      at each time point before euthanasia. In clinical trials, patients received an 
      i.v.t. injection of approximately 352 μg sirolimus. Sirolimus concentrations in 
      ocular tissues and WB samples were measured using liquid chromatography/tandem 
      mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). In both single- and repeat-dose tolerability 
      studies, systemic and ocular adverse effects were evaluated. RESULTS: After 
      i.v.t. administration, sirolimus formed a depot in the VH. During dissolution, 
      concentrations in VH were dose related and exhibited continuous release from the 
      depot. This was characterized by a gradient of sirolimus concentration in the 
      order of VH > retina/choroid > sclera > WB, and the concentrations were 
      maintained for approximately 2 months after the i.v.t. injection. After repeat 
      dosing (132 μg), no drug accumulation was seen in the ocular tissue or 
      systemically. In clinical studies, the highest blood levels were <2 ng/mL at day 
      2, and half-time (t(1/2)) was 8-9 days. There was no accumulation at day 30 after 
      the i.v.t. injection (up to 352 μg). Safety studies conducted on rabbits 
      indicated good local tolerability. Sirolimus-related effects were limited to 
      minor incipient cataract findings and mild lenticular changes. In the clinical 
      studies where sirolimus was intravitreally administered up to 352 μg, injections 
      were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained i.v.t. delivery was achieved in a 
      dose-dependent fashion after the i.v.t. injection of a proprietary sirolimus 
      depot-forming ocular formulation. Across the tolerability and safety studies, no 
      significant findings were observed for systemic and ocular tolerability. The 
      human WB levels were well below the daily trough systemic blood level range 
      required for systemic immunosuppression. An i.v.t. injection of sirolimus has a 
      PK and safety profile that is favorable for treating inflammatory conditions of 
      the eye, such as non-infectious uveitis, and warrants further investigation in 
      humans.

AB  - The pharmacokinetics of inhaled rapamycin (RAPA) is compared for amorphous versus 
      crystalline dry powder formulations. The amorphous formulation of RAPA and 
      lactose (RapaLac) was prepared by thin film freezing (TFF) using lactose as the 
      stabilizing agent in the weight ratio 1:1. The crystalline formulation was 
      prepared by wet ball milling RAPA and lactose and posteriorly blending the 
      mixture with coarse lactose (micronized RAPA/micronized lactose/coarse 
      lactose=0.5:0.5:19). While both powders presented good aerosolization performance 
      for lung delivery, TFF formulation exhibited better in vitro aerodynamic 
      properties than the crystalline physical mixture. Single-dose 24h pharmacokinetic 
      studies were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats following inhalation of the aerosol 
      mist in a nose-only inhalation exposure system. Lung deposition was higher for 
      the crystalline group than for the TFF group. Despite higher pulmonary levels of 
      drug that were found for the crystalline group, the systemic circulation 
      (AUC₀₋₂₄) was higher for the amorphous group (8.6 ngh/mL) than for crystalline 
      group (2.4 ngh/mL) based on a five-compartmental analysis. Lung level profiles 
      suggest that TTF powder stays in the lung for the same period of time as the 
      crystalline powder but it presented higher in vivo systemic bioavailability due 
      to its enhanced solubility, faster dissolution rate and increased FPF at a more 
      distal part of the lungs.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of the immunosuppressant everolimus in maintenance renal 
      transplant patients.
PG  - 169-74
AB  - The novel macrocyclic immunosuppressant everolimus has been approved for use in 
      renal and heart transplantation. The objective of this randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, dose-escalating Phase 1 study was to evaluate the 
      pharmacokinetic profile of different dosing regimens of everolimus. Fifty-four 
      subjects were randomized for 4-weeks treatment with everolimus (n = 44) or 
      placebo (n = 10). Steady state was reached by day 4 of multiple dosing with 
      evidence for dose-proportionality over the dose range tested. Systemic 
      accumulation was 1.6- to 2.2-fold with multiple dosing. Steady-state predose 
      trough concentrations were well correlated with AUC (r = 0.87, p < 0.001). 
      Within-subject coefficients of variation for the tablet formulation ranged from 
      10-19% and between-subject coefficients from 34-60% for Cmax and AUC. There was 
      no effect of common demographic parameters (age, sex, weight) on variability in 
      steady-state exposure. These results support the clinical use of everolimus in 
      renal transplantation.

TI  - A multicenter, first-in-pediatrics, phase 1, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      study of ridaforolimus in patients with refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 3649-58
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-3166 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ridaforolimus (MK-8669, AP23573) is a potent and selective mammalian 
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor. Preclinically, ridaforolimus displays 
      antiproliferative activity against a variety of human tumors in vitro and tumor 
      xenograft models in vivo, with additive or synergistic activity when combined 
      with other anticancer agents. Antitumor activity has been confirmed in adults. 
      This phase I study determined the safety, pharmacological, biologic, and toxicity 
      profiles of ridaforolimus in pediatric patients with refractory malignancies. 
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eligible children ages 1 to 18 years with advanced solid 
      tumors were enrolled in a 3 + 3 dose escalation design, to determine the safety, 
      tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of 
      ridaforolimus. Toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics were 
      characterized. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were treated. No DLT was observed at any 
      dose level tested; therefore, an MTD was not identified. Most adverse events were 
      mild to moderate; the most common grades 3 and 4 adverse events were hematologic, 
      including thrombocytopenia and anemia. Nonhematologic adverse events were mostly 
      electrolyte disturbances. The observed pharmacokinetic profile of ridaforolimus 
      in children was consistent with that previously showed in adults. Pharmacodynamic 
      confirms that the dose range tested has pharmacological/pharmacodynamic activity. 
      Forty percent of patients achieved stable disease including four of six with 
      central nervous system tumors and two of eight with sarcomas. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      first-in-pediatrics study shows that the second-generation mTOR inhibitor 
      ridaforolimus is well tolerated in heavily pretreated children with refractory 
      solid tumors. No DLTs were observed over the dose range tested. Ridaforolimus may 
      represent a therapeutic option for use in pediatric malignancies.

TI  - Influence of delayed initiation of cyclosporine on everolimus pharmacokinetics in 
      de novo renal transplant patients.
PG  - 1576-80
AB  - We quantified the influence of delayed initiation of cyclosporine on everolimus 
      pharmacokinetics in order to provide dosing guidance for kidney transplant 
      patients. In a randomized multicenter study, 56 de novo kidney transplant 
      patients received everolimus, basiliximab, corticosteroids and either immediate 
      (n = 40) or delayed (n = 16) initiation of cyclosporine based on renal function. 
      Everolimus and cyclosporine predose blood levels (Cmin) were obtained over the 
      first 3 months post-transplant. Everolimus Cmin averaged 9-11 ng/mL in the 
      immediate cyclosporine group over the first 3 months. In the delayed cyclosporine 
      group, average everolimus Cmins were significantly lower by 2.9-fold in the 
      absence vs. presence of cyclosporine: 2.9 +/- 2.8 vs. 8.3 +/- 3.7 ng/mL (p < 
      0.001). Likewise, the within-patient ratio of everolimus Cmins in the 
      presence/absence of cyclosporine averaged 2.9 (range, 0.7-5.6). Both everolimus 
      and cyclosporine blood concentrations need to be monitored in kidney transplant 
      patients with delayed graft function during the period when cyclosporine is 
      withheld and shortly after its initiation. Dosing of everolimus needs to be 
      adjusted to take into account an average threefold increase in everolimus 
      exposure when cyclosporine is added to the regimen.

AB  - To enhance the dissolution and oral absorption of water insoluble drug sirolimus 
      (SRL), self-microemulsifying pellets of SRL were developed and evaluated. 
      Solubility test, self-emulsifying grading test, ternary phase diagrams and 
      central composite design were adopted to screen and optimize the composition of 
      liquid SRL-SMEDDS. The selected liquid SRL-SMEDDS formulations were prepared into 
      pellets by extrusion-spheronization method and the optimal formulation of 1mg 
      SRL-SMEDDS pellets capsule (1.0, 22.4, 38.4, 19.2, 121.6, 30.4 and 8.0 mg of SRL, 
      Labrafil M1944CS, Cremophor EL, Transcutol P, MCC, Lactose and CMS-Na, 
      respectively) was finally determinated by the feasibility of the preparing 
      process and redispersibility. The optimal SRL-SMEDDS pellets showed a significant 
      quicker redispersion rate than the dissolution rate of commercial SRL tablets 
      Rapamune in water. The droplet size and polydispersity index of the reconstituted 
      microemulsion was almost unchanged after solidification, and pellet size and 
      friability were all qualified. Visual observation and scanning electron 
      microscopic analysis confirmed good appearance of the solid pellets. DSC, XRPD, 
      and IR analysis confirmed that there was no crystalline sirolimus in the pellets. 
      Pharmacokinetic study in beagle dogs showed the oral relative bioavailability of 
      SRL-SMEDDS pellets to the commercial SRL tablets Rapamune was about 136.9%. In 
      conclusion, the solid SMEDDS pellets might be an encouraging strategy to improve 
      the oral absorption of SRL and the extrusion-spheronization method was a feasible 
      technology for the solidification of liquid SMEDDS.

PG  - 4554-61
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2009.27.5867 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Synergistic/additive cytotoxicity in tumor models and widespread 
      applicability of fluoropyrimidines in solid tumors prompted the study of the 
      combination of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, non-prodrug 
      rapamycin analog ridaforolimus, with capecitabine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Thirty-two adult patients were treated. Intravenous ridaforolimus was given once 
      weekly for 3 weeks and capecitabine was given from days 1 to 14 every 4 weeks. 
      Ridaforolimus was given at 25, 37.5, 50, or 75 mg with capecitabine at 1,650 
      mg/m(2) or 1,800 mg/m(2) divided into two daily doses. Pharmacokinetics of both 
      drugs were determined during cycles 1 and 2. Pharmacodynamic studies in 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and wound tissue of the skin 
      characterized pathways associated with the metabolism or disposition of 
      fluoropyrimidines and mTOR and ERK signaling. RESULTS: Two recommended doses 
      (RDs) were defined: 75 mg ridaforolimus/1,650 mg/m(2) capecitabine and 50 mg 
      ridaforolimus/1,800 mg/m(2) capecitabine. Dose-limiting toxicities were 
      stomatitis and skin rash. One patient achieved a partial response lasting 10 
      months and 10 of 29 evaluable patients had stable disease for ≥ 6 months. The 
      only pharmacokinetic interaction was a ridaforolimus-induced increase in plasma 
      exposure to fluorouracil. PBMC data suggested that prolonged exposure to 
      capecitabine reduced the ridaforolimus inhibition of mTOR. Ridaforolimus 
      influenced the metabolism of fluoropyrimidines and inhibited dihydropyrimidine 
      dehydrogenase, behavior similar to that of rapamycin. Inhibition of the target 
      thymidylate synthase by capecitabine was unaffected. mTOR and ERK signaling was 
      inhibited in proliferating endothelial cells and was more pronounced at the RD 
      with the larger amount of ridaforolimus. CONCLUSION: Good tolerability, 
      feasibility of prolonged treatment, antitumor activity, and favorable 
      pharmacologic profile support further investigation of this combination.

TI  - Phase I study of vinblastine and temsirolimus in pediatric patients with 
      recurrent or refractory solid tumors: Canadian Cancer Trials Group Study IND.218.
PG  - e27540
LID - 10.1002/pbc.27540 [doi]
AB  - Combining mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and vinca alkaloids has 
      shown therapeutic synergy in xenograft models of pediatric cancers. This phase I 
      study assessed safety and toxicity of temsirolimus in combination with 
      vinblastine in children. PROCEDURE: Patients ≥ 1 and ≤ 18 years with 
      recurrent/refractory solid or CNS tumors were eligible. Vinblastine (4 mg/m(2) ) 
      and temsirolimus (15 mg/m(2) ) were administered i.v. weekly, with planned dose 
      escalation of vinblastine using a rolling six phase I design. Pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic data were collected. RESULTS: Seven patients with median age 12 
      years (range, 8-18 years) were enrolled; all were evaluable for toxicity and six 
      for response. At dose level 1, four of six patients developed grade 3 mucositis, 
      of which one met duration criteria for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Four 
      patients required dose omissions for grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, including 
      one prolonged neutropenia DLT. A subsequent patient was enrolled on dose level -2 
      (temsirolimus 10 mg/m(2) , vinblastine 4 mg/m(2) ) with no protocol-related 
      toxicity > grade 1, except grade 2 neutropenia. Two serious adverse events (SAE) 
      occurred-an allergic reaction to temsirolimus (grade 2) and an intracranial 
      hemorrhage in a CNS tumor patient (grade 3)-unlikely related to study therapy. 
      Soluble VEGFR2 was reduced at cycle 1, day 36 in keeping with inhibition of 
      angiogenesis. Four patients achieved prolonged stable disease for a median of 5.0 
      months (range, 3.1-8.3 months). CONCLUSION: The combination of weekly 
      temsirolimus (15 mg/m(2) ) and vinblastine (4 mg/m(2) ) exceeds the maximum 
      tolerated dose in children, with frequent oral mucositis and hematologic 
      toxicity.

TI  - Comparative pharmacokinetics of RAD001 (everolimus) in normal and tumor-bearing 
      rodents.
PG  - 625-39
LID - 10.1007/s00280-009-1068-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Comparative pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 
      (everolimus) in rats and mice. METHODS: Blood cell partitioning, plasma protein 
      binding and PK parameters of RAD001 in blood and tissues (including brain) of 
      both mice and rats were determined. PK modeling predicted plasma/blood and tumor 
      levels from a variety of regimens and these were compared with the known human PK 
      profile. DCE-MRI was used to compare tumor vascularity between mice and rats. 
      Estimation of IC50 values in vitro and ED50 values in vivo were used to provide 
      an indication of anti-tumor activity. RESULTS: The PK properties of RAD001 
      differed between mice and rats, including erythrocyte partitioning, plasma 
      protein binding, plasma/blood t(1/2), oral bioavailability, volume of 
      distribution, tissue/tumor penetration and elimination. Modeling of tumor and 
      blood/plasma PK suggested that in mice, multiple daily administrations result in 
      a 2-fold increase in tumor levels of RAD001 at steady state, whereas in rats, a 
      7.9-fold increase would occur. Weekly high-dose regimens were predicted not to 
      facilitate tumor accumulation in either species. Total tumor levels of RAD001 
      were four- to eight-fold greater in rats than in mice. Rat tumors had a >2-fold 
      greater plasma content and permeability compared to mouse tumors, which could 
      contribute to differences in tumor drug uptake. Maximal antitumor effects (T/C of 
      0.04-0.35) were observed in both species after daily administration with similar 
      C(max) and AUC values of unbound (free) RAD001. These free levels of RAD001 are 
      exceeded in serum from cancer patients receiving clinically beneficial daily 
      regimens. In rodents, brain penetration of RAD001 was poor, but was 
      dose-dependent and showed over-proportional uptake in rats with a longer t(1/2) 
      compared to the systemic circulation. CONCLUSIONS: The PK of RAD001 differed 
      between mice and rats, with rats having a PK profile closer to that of humans. 
      High intermittent doses of RAD001 may be more appropriate for treatment of brain 
      tumors.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and tolerability of 40-0-[2-hydroxyethyl]rapamycin in de novo 
      liver transplant recipients.
PG  - 160-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: 40-0-[2-Hydroxyethyl]rapamycin (RAD), a novel macrolide with potent 
      immunosuppressive and antiproliferative activities, prevents rejection in animal 
      allotransplantation models. This phase I trial assessed the effects of bile 
      diversion, administration route, and time after transplant on RAD 
      pharmacokinetics after single-dose administration in de novo liver allograft 
      recipients. The influence of RAD on cyclosporine (CsA) pharmacokinetics and the 
      safety of RAD were also evaluated. METHODS: Twenty-six de novo liver allograft 
      recipients were assigned to one of four treatment groups based on the presence or 
      absence of a T tube, administration route (nasogastric or nasoduodenal), and 
      timing of RAD administration. Patients received a single 7.5-mg RAD dose on one 
      to three occasions in addition to CsA (Neoral) and corticosteroids. Steady-state 
      cyclosporine profiles with and without RAD coadministration were evaluated. 
      Results. Recipients with bile diversion demonstrated lower peak concentration 
      (Cmax) than those without, but overall drug exposure (AUC) was not altered. Cmax 
      and AUC were not influenced by administration route. A trend towards higher Cmax 
      on postoperative day 3 than on postoperative day 1 was noted, although AUC was 
      not altered. Single-dose RAD coadministration did not affect steady-state CsA 
      pharmacokinetics. RAD was well tolerated and caused few drug-related adverse 
      effects. RAD administration did not increase infection rates or produce 
      clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters. Conclusions. In de novo 
      liver transplant recipients, the overall extent of RAD absorption was not 
      influenced by bile diversion, administration route, or time of administration. 
      CsA pharmacokinetics were not affected by single-dose RAD coadministration. RAD 
      capsules administered in single doses of 7.5 mg were well tolerated and safe.

PG  - 753-9
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31829a7a7c [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited data analyzing the pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
      pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of everolimus (EVR) between African Americans and 
      Caucasians. The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the EVR PKs 
      and concentration-associated efficacy and toxicity in African American and 
      Caucasian adult kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: This was a retrospective 
      PK and PD analysis of all patients who received EVR at the Medical University of 
      South Carolina Transplant Center between 2006 and 2012. RESULTS: Forty-three 
      patients received EVR (22 African Americans, 21 Caucasians). Baseline 
      demographics, immunosuppression, and immunologic risk were similar between races, 
      except for preexisting hypertension, deceased donor type, and cold ischemic time, 
      which were higher in African American patients. PK analysis revealed that African 
      American patients received higher initial EVR doses (2.1 ± 0.8 versus 1.6 ± 0.6 
      mg/d, P = 0.036), leading to higher early EVR concentrations (EVR >6 ng/mL during 
      the first 60 days: 36% versus 10%, P = 0.037). Efficacy analysis demonstrated 
      similar EVR effects on acute rejection rates (9% versus 10%, P = 0.961), chronic 
      allograft changes (18% versus 14%, P = 0.729), and renal function, with both 
      groups having improved creatinine clearance with EVR therapy (ΔeGFR: 27 versus 12 
      mL·min·1.73 m). Toxicity analysis demonstrated that African American patients had 
      a trend toward higher rates of EVR discontinuation (46% versus 19%, P = 0.065) 
      and significantly more diarrhea/gastrointestinal intolerance (73% versus 38%, P = 
      0.022). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate EVR therapy is effective at 
      preventing rejection and improving graft function in both African American and 
      Caucasian adult renal transplant patients. Conflicting with previous mammalian 
      target of rapamycin PK/PD analyses in African American patients, this study 
      cohort demonstrated higher early EVR levels in the African American patients.

TI  - Conversion from liquid to solid rapamycin formulations in stable renal allograft 
      transplant recipients.
PG  - 249-53
AB  - Sirolimus (rapamycin, RAPA, Rapamunetrade mark) is a potent immunosuppressive 
      agent currently being investigated for prophylaxis against acute rejection 
      episodes in renal transplant recipients. In the present study, stable renal 
      allograft recipients under maintenance therapy with RAPA and cyclosporine (CsA) 
      were converted from the original oil-based liquid RAPA to a solid tablet 
      formulation on a milligram-to-milligram basis, in order to evaluate the 
      pharmacokinetics and safety of this new dosage form. Twelve-hour pharmacokinetic 
      (PK) profiles of both RAPA and CsA were conducted with the final liquid RAPA 
      dose, and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks postconversion to the solid tablet. In addition, 
      the parameters of the PK profiles for the solid formulation were compared with 
      those for liquid RAPA, which were performed prior to this study. Area under the 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) values for the liquid formulation and for the 
      solid tablet at 2, 4, and 8 weeks postconversion were 256.5, 205.8, 226.1, and 
      224.4 ng.h/mL, respectively (p=NS). Time to maximum RAPA concentration was longer 
      at 4 weeks postconversion, but similar at 2 and 8 weeks. There were no 
      differences observed between the liquid and solid tablet trough concentrations. 
      The only significant differences observed among the PK parameters of the solid 
      tablet versus those of the liquid formulation were the lower C(max) values of the 
      solid, namely 25.3, 24.9, and 26.7 ng/mL versus 37.1 ng/mL (p<0.05). In addition, 
      the dose corrected C(max) was lower in the solid tablet PK profiles compared with 
      the prior PK profiles for the liquid (7.7 versus 10.2 ng/mL, p<0.02). 
      Cyclosporine AUC values did not change appreciably during the study. Conversion 
      from the liquid to the solid formulation was neither associated with episodes of 
      acute rejection, nor changes in laboratory values, during the 8-week study. In 
      summary, conversion from the liquid to the solid RAPA formulation resulted in 
      similar PK profiles and appears to be both safe and well-tolerated in renal 
      transplant recipients.

TI  - Phase I clinical and pharmacokinetic study of RAD001 (everolimus) administered 
      daily to Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 17-23

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of RAD001 (everolimus) in 
      Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors. METHODS: An open-label, 
      non-randomized, dose-escalation Phase I study of RAD001 administered continuously 
      once daily in a 28-day cycle was performed. The study had a '3 + 3' design, with 
      three patients recruited to each of three successive cohorts treated with RAD001 
      at 2.5, 5.0 or 10.0 mg/day. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of RAD001 in Japanese 
      patients were similar to those previously determined in Caucasians. The drug 
      safety profile was consistent with that of a mammalian target of rapamycin 
      inhibitor. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. One patient with esophageal 
      cancer and one with gastric cancer treated with RAD001 at 10 mg/day showed marked 
      tumor responses. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of Japanese cancer patients with RAD001 
      may be undertaken with the expectation that previously determined pharmacokinetic 
      and safety profiles apply. The drug may hold promise for treatment of esophageal 
      and gastric cancer.

TI  - A phase I trial of ANG1/2-Tie2 inhibitor trebaninib (AMG386) and temsirolimus in 
      advanced solid tumors (PJC008/NCI♯9041).
PG  - 104-11
LID - 10.1007/s10637-015-0313-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is crosstalk between the ANG-Tie2 and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR 
      pathways. Combined ANG1/2 and mTOR blockade may have additive anti-cancer 
      activity. The combination of trebananib, an inhibitor of ANG1/2-Tie2 interaction, 
      with temsirolimus was evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumors to 
      determine tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and preliminary antitumor 
      activity. METHODS: Patients were enrolled using 3 + 3 design, and were given 
      intravenous trebananib and temsirolimus on Day 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle. 
      Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were evaluated during cycle 1. Peripheral blood 
      was collected for evaluation of Tie2-expressing monocytes (TEMs) and thymidine 
      phosphorylase (TP). Sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling for trebananib drug 
      levels was performed on Day 1 and 8 of cycle 2. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were 
      enrolled, 6 at dose level (DL) 1, 7 at DL -1, and 8 at DL -2. No effect of 
      temsirolimus on trebananib PK was observed. The most common treatment-related 
      adverse events (AEs) were: fatigue (81 %), edema (62 %), anorexia (57 %), nausea 
      (52 %), rash (43 %) and mucositis (43 %). The most common grade ≥ 3 AEs included 
      lymphopenia (28 %) and fatigue (28 %). The MTD was exceeded at DL-2. Of 18 
      response evaluable patients, 1 partial response was observed (ER+/HER2-/PIK3CA 
      mutant breast cancer) and 4 patients had prolonged SD ≥ 24 weeks. No correlation 
      with clinical benefit was observed with change in number TEMs or TP expression in 
      TEMs with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The MTD was exceeded at trebananib 10 mg/kg 
      weekly and temsirolimus 20 mg weekly, with frequent overlapping toxicities 
      including fatigue, edema, and anorexia.

      coadministered with intravenous temsirolimus.
PG  - 263-70
LID - 10.1007/s00280-008-0865-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Intravenous (i.v.) temsirolimus, a novel inhibitor of mammalian target 
      of rapamycin (mTOR), is approved for treatment of renal cell carcinoma. In vitro 
      studies with pooled human liver microsomes showed that temsirolimus and its 
      principal metabolite, sirolimus, inhibit the CYP2D6 isozyme (K(i) = 1.5 and 5 
      microM, respectively), indicating potential for pharmacokinetic interaction with 
      agents that are substrates of CYP2D6. METHODS: This 2-period study in healthy 
      subjects investigated the pharmacokinetics of a single oral 50-mg dose of the 
      CYP2D6 substrate desipramine, first without and subsequently with a single 
      coadministered i.v. 25-mg dose of temsirolimus. RESULTS: The study population 
      consisted of 25 males and 1 female; 10 were black, 12 were white, and 4 were of 
      other races. Plasma and whole blood samples were available from all 26 subjects 
      in period 1 following oral desipramine and from 23 subjects in period 2 following 
      oral desipramine and i.v. temsirolimus coadministration. The 90% confidence 
      intervals for least squares geometric mean ratios of desipramine and 
      2-hydroxy-desipramine C(max), AUC(T), and AUC were within 80-125%, indicating 
      that parameter differences did not manifest into clinically relevant exposure 
      changes. A single i.v. 25-mg dose of temsirolimus, alone or with desipramine, was 
      well tolerated in healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: A single i.v. 25-mg dose of 
      temsirolimus did not alter disposition of desipramine. Temsirolimus i.v. 25 mg 
      may be safely administered with agents metabolized through the CYP2D6 pathway, 
      but vigilance for drug interaction is warranted in patients with advanced 
      malignancies.

      hepatic impairment.
PG  - 1368-72
AB  - Eighteen adult subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and 18 healthy 
      control subjects were given a single 15-mg dose of sirolimus by oral solution. 
      Mean whole-blood sirolimus weight-normalized oral-dose clearances (CL/F) were 
      significantly decreased (P = .02) in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic 
      impairment by -31.8% and -36.0%, respectively, compared with controls. There were 
      no significant differences in mean sirolimus C(max) and t(max) values among 
      groups. The observed decreases in CL/F may be relevant in renal transplant 
      patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, based on the close similarity 
      of sirolimus CL/F in controls and previously studied stable renal transplant 
      patients receiving multiple-dose administration of sirolimus and cyclosporine. 
      There was considerable overlap in the CL/F values of hepatic-impaired subjects 
      and controls, suggesting that whole-blood sirolimus trough concentrations in 
      renal transplant patients exhibiting mild to moderate hepatic impairment be 
      initially monitored to assess the need for dose adjustments.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus and sirolimus in children with 
      recurrent solid tumours: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.
PG  - 1097-1107
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13181 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Temsirolimus is an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). 
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) characterization of temsirolimus in children is limited and 
      there is no paediatric temsirolimus population PK model available. The objective 
      of this study was to simultaneously characterize the PK of temsirolimus and its 
      metabolite sirolimus in paediatric patients with recurrent solid or central 
      nervous system tumours and to develop a population PK model. METHODS: The PK data 
      for temsirolimus and sirolimus were collected as a part of a Children's Oncology 
      Group phase I clinical trial in paediatric patients with recurrent solid tumours. 
      Serial blood concentrations obtained from 19 patients participating in the PK 
      portion of the study were used for the analysis. Population PK analysis was 
      performed by nonlinear mixed effect modelling using NONMEM. RESULTS: A 
      three-compartment model with zero-order infusion was found to best describe 
      temsirolimus PK. Allometrically scaled body weight was included in the model to 
      account for body size differences. Temsirolimus dose was identified as a 
      significant covariate on clearance. A sirolimus metabolite formation model was 
      developed and integrated with the temsirolimus model. A two-compartment structure 
      model adequately described the sirolimus data. CONCLUSION: This study is the 
      first to describe a population PK model of temsirolimus combined with sirolimus 
      formation and disposition in paediatric patients. The developed model will 
      facilitate PK model-based dose individualization of temsirolimus and the design 
      of future clinical studies in children.

TI  - Rapamycin pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships in osteosarcoma: a 
      comparative oncology study in dogs.
PG  - e11013
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0011013 [doi]
LID - e11013
AB  - BACKGROUND: Signaling through the mTOR pathway contributes to growth, progression 
      and chemoresistance of several cancers. Accordingly, inhibitors have been 
      developed as potentially valuable therapeutics. Their optimal development 
      requires consideration of dose, regimen, biomarkers and a rationale for their use 
      in combination with other agents. Using the infrastructure of the Comparative 
      Oncology Trials Consortium many of these complex questions were asked within a 
      relevant population of dogs with osteosarcoma to inform the development of mTOR 
      inhibitors for future use in pediatric osteosarcoma patients. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This prospective dose escalation study of a 
      parenteral formulation of rapamycin sought to define a safe, pharmacokinetically 
      relevant, and pharmacodynamically active dose of rapamycin in dogs with 
      appendicular osteosarcoma. Dogs entered into dose cohorts consisting of 3 
      dogs/cohort. Dogs underwent a pre-treatment tumor biopsy and collection of 
      baseline PBMC. Dogs received a single intramuscular dose of rapamycin and 
      underwent 48-hour whole blood pharmacokinetic sampling. Additionally, daily 
      intramuscular doses of rapamycin were administered for 7 days with blood 
      rapamycin trough levels collected on Day 8, 9 and 15. At Day 8 post-treatment 
      collection of tumor and PBMC were obtained. No maximally tolerated dose of 
      rapamycin was attained through escalation to the maximal planned dose of 0.08 
      mg/kg (2.5 mg/30 kg dog). Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a dose-dependent 
      exposure. In all cohorts modulation of the mTOR pathway in tumor and PBMC 
      (pS6RP/S6RP) was demonstrated. No change in pAKT/AKT was seen in tumor samples 
      following rapamycin therapy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Rapamycin may be safely 
      administered to dogs and can yield therapeutic exposures. Modulation pS6RP/S6RP 
      in tumor tissue and PBMCs was not dependent on dose. Results from this study 
      confirm that the dog may be included in the translational development of 
      rapamycin and potentially other mTOR inhibitors. Ongoing studies of rapamycin in 
      dogs will define optimal schedules for their use in cancer and evaluate the role 
      of rapamycin use in the setting of minimal residual disease.

TI  - Targeting Refractory Sarcomas and Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors in a 
      Phase I/II Study of Sirolimus in Combination with Ganetespib (SARC023).
PG  - 5784876
LID - 10.1155/2020/5784876 [doi]
LID - 5784876
AB  - PURPOSE: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive soft 
      tissue sarcomas. Combining Hsp90 inhibitors to enhance endoplasmic reticulum 
      stress with mTOR inhibition results in dramatic MPNST shrinkage in a genetically 
      engineered MPNST mouse model. Ganetespib is an injectable potent small molecule 
      inhibitor of Hsp90. Sirolimus is an oral mTOR inhibitor. We sought to determine 
      the safety, tolerability, and recommended dose of ganetespib and sirolimus in 
      patients with refractory sarcomas and assess clinical benefits in patients with 
      unresectable/refractory MPNSTs. Patients and Methods. In this 
      multi-institutional, open-label, phase 1/2 study of ganetespib and sirolimus, 
      patients ≥16 years with histologically confirmed refractory sarcoma (phase 1) or 
      MPNST (phase 2) were eligible. A conventional 3 + 3 dose escalation design was 
      used for phase 1. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measures were evaluated. 
      Primary objectives of phase 2 were to determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR) 
      of this combination in MPNSTs. Patient-reported outcomes assessed pain. RESULTS: 
      Twenty patients were enrolled (10 per phase). Toxicities were manageable; most 
      frequent non-DLTs were diarrhea, elevated liver transaminases, and fatigue. The 
      recommended dose of ganetespib was 200 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 
      with sirolimus 4 mg orally once daily with day 1 loading dose of 12 mg. In phase 
      1, one patient with leiomyosarcoma achieved a sustained partial response. In 
      phase 2, no responses were observed. The median number of cycles treated was 2 
      (1-4). Patients did not meet the criteria for clinical benefit as defined per 
      protocol. Pain ratings decreased or were stable. CONCLUSION: Despite promising 
      preclinical rationale and tolerability of the combination therapy, no responses 
      were observed, and the study did not meet parameters for further evaluation in 
      MPNSTs. This trial was registered with (NCT02008877).

TI  - Phase 1 and pharmacokinetic study of everolimus in combination with cetuximab and 
      carboplatin for recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and 
      neck.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Platinum-based therapy combined with cetuximab is standard first-line 
      therapy for recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 
      (RMSCCHN). Preclinical studies have suggested that mammalian target of rapamycin 
      inhibitors may overcome resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor blockers 
      and may augment cetuximab antitumor activity. We conducted a phase 1b trial of 
      carboplatin, cetuximab, and everolimus for untreated RMSCCHN. METHODS: Patients 
      received carboplatin (area under the curve = 2 mg/ml/min; 3 weeks on, 1 week 
      off), cetuximab (with a loading dose of 400 mg/m(2) and then 250 mg/m(2) weekly), 
      and dose-escalating everolimus (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 mg/day) with a 3+3 design. 
      After 4 cycles, patients without progression continued cetuximab/everolimus until 
      progression or intolerable toxicity. Patients (age ≥ 18 years) had previously 
      untreated, unresectable RMSCCHN not amenable to radiotherapy and an Eastern 
      Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2. RESULTS: The study 
      enrolled 20 patients (male/female = 18/2) with RMSCCHN; the median age was 65 
      years (44-75 years). Thirteen patients received everolimus (male/female = 92%). 
      Two of 6 patients receiving 2.5 mg/day experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) 
      with grade 3 hyponatremia and nausea. In 7 patients receiving de-escalated 
      everolimus (2.5 mg every other day), grade 3 hyperglycemia produced DLT in 1 of 6 
      patients. The objective response rate (RR) was 61.5% (all partial responses). 
      Progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.15 months. The pharmacokinetics of 
      everolimus was described with a 2-compartment mixed-effects model. There was a 
      significant correlation between tumor p-p44/42 staining and response (P = .044) 
      and a marginally significant correlation between phosphorylated mammalian target 
      of rapamycin and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose of 
      everolimus with cetuximab and carboplatin was 2.5 mg every other day. The regimen 
      was associated with an encouraging RR and PFS, and this suggested possible 
      clinical efficacy in a select group of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of 
      the head and neck.

TI  - A Phase I and Surgical Study of Ribociclib and Everolimus in Children with 
      Recurrent or Refractory Malignant Brain Tumors: A Pediatric Brain Tumor 
      Consortium Study.
PG  - 2442-2451
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-4078 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Genomic aberrations in cell cycle and PI3K pathways are commonly 
      observed in pediatric brain tumors. This study determined the MTD/recommended 
      phase II dose (RP2D) of ribociclib and everolimus and characterized single-agent 
      ribociclib concentrations in plasma and tumor in children undergoing resection. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were enrolled in the phase I study according to a 
      rolling 6 design and received ribociclib and everolimus daily for 21 and 28 days, 
      respectively. Surgical patients received ribociclib at the pediatric RP2D (350 
      mg/m(2)) for 7-10 days preoperatively followed by enrollment on the phase I 
      study. Pharmacokinetics were analyzed for both cohorts. RESULTS: Sixteen patients 
      were enrolled on the phase I study (median age, 10.3 years; range, 3.9-20.4) and 
      6 patients in the surgical cohort (median age, 11.4 years; range: 7.2-17.1). 
      Thirteen patients were enrolled at dose level 1 without dose-limiting toxicities 
      (DLT). Two of the 3 patients at dose level 2 experienced DLTs (grade 3 
      hypertension and grade 4 alanine aminotransferase). The most common grade 3/4 
      toxicities were lymphopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia. The RP2D of ribociclib 
      and everolimus was 120 and 1.2 mg/m(2) for 21 and 28 days, respectively. 
      Steady-state everolimus exposures with ribociclib were 2.5-fold higher than 
      everolimus administered alone. Ribociclib plasma, tumor concentrations, and 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected. The mean tumor-to-plasma ratio 
      of ribociclib was 19.8 (range, 2.22-53.4). CONCLUSIONS: Ribociclib and everolimus 
      were well-tolerated and demonstrated pharmacokinetic properties similar to those 
      in adults. Potential therapeutic ribociclib concentrations could be achieved in 
      CSF and tumor tissue, although interpatient variability was observed.

TI  - Phase I/pharmacokinetic study of CCI-779 in patients with recurrent malignant 
      glioma on enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs.
PG  - 427-35
AB  - OBJECTIVES: CCI-779 is an ester of the immunosuppressive agent sirolimus 
      (rapamycin) that causes cell-cycle arrest at G1 via inhibition of key signaling 
      pathways resulting in inhibition of RNA translation. Antitumor activity has been 
      demonstrated using cell lines and animal models of malignant glioma. Patients 
      receiving enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) can have altered 
      metabolism of drugs like CCI-779 that are metabolized through the hepatic 
      cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The objectives of this study were to determine the 
      pharmacokinetic profile and the maximum tolerated dose of CCI-779 in patients 
      with recurrent malignant gliioma taking EIAEDs. STUDY DESIGN: The starting dose 
      of CCI-779 was 250 mg intravenously (IV) administered weekly on a continuous 
      basis. Standard dose escalation was performed until the maximum tolerated dose 
      was established. Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute common 
      toxicity criteria. RESULTS: Two of 6 patients treated at the second dose level of 
      330 mg sustained a dose-limiting toxicity: grade III stomatitis, grade 3 
      hypercholesterolemia, or grade 4 hypertriglyceridemia. The maximum tolerated dose 
      was reached at 250 mg IV. Pharmacokinetic profiles were similar to those 
      previously described, but the area under the whole blood concentration-time curve 
      of rapamycin was 1.6 fold lower for patients on EIAEDs. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      recommended phase II dose of CCI 779 for patients on enzyme-inducing 
      antiepileptic drugs is 250 mg IV weekly. A phase II study is ongoing to determine 
      the efficacy of this agent.

TI  - Phase Ib study of weekly mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor ridaforolimus 
      (AP23573; MK-8669) with weekly paclitaxel.

LID - S0923-7534(19)39297-X [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The additive cytotoxicity in vitro prompted a clinical study 
      evaluating the non-prodrug rapamycin analogue ridaforolimus (AP23573; MK-8669; 
      formerly deforolimus) administered i.v. combined with paclitaxel (PTX; Taxol). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with taxane-sensitive solid tumors were eligible. 
      The main dose escalation foresaw 50% ridaforolimus increments from 25 mg with a 
      fixed PTX dose of 80 mg/m(2), both given weekly 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle. 
      Collateral levels with a lower dose of either drug were planned upon achievement 
      of the maximum tolerated dose in the main escalation. Pharmacodynamic studies in 
      plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and skin biopsies and 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction studies at cycles 1 and 2 were carried out. 
      RESULTS: Two recommended doses were determined: 37.5 mg ridaforolimus/60 mg/m(2) 
      PTX and 12.5 mg/80 mg/m(2). Most frequent toxic effects were mouth sores (79%), 
      anemia (79%), fatigue (59%), neutropenia (55%) and dermatitis (48%). Two partial 
      responses were observed in pharyngeal squamous cell and pancreatic carcinoma. 
      Eight patients achieved stable disease > or =4 months. No drug interaction 
      emerged from PK studies. Decrease of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding 
      protein1 (4E-BP1) phosphorylation was shown in PBMCs. Similar inhibition of 
      phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase was present in 
      reparative epidermis and vascular tissues, respectively. CONCLUSION: Potential 
      antiangiogenic effects and encouraging antitumor activity justify further 
      development of the combination.

TI  - 12-hour area under the curve cyclosporine concentrations determined by a 
      validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry procedure compared with 
      fluorescence polarization immunoassay reveals sirolimus effect on cyclosporine 
      pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 726-36
AB  - Liquid chromatographic (LC) procedures have been applied to cyclosporine 
      therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) since the agent was introduced in 1983. In 
      recent years, the advance to mass spectrometric (MS) detection has enhanced the 
      capability of LC by providing more sensitive and selective detection, a wider 
      analytical range, faster turnaround time, and relative ease of use. Although 
      fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) is a widely popular technology for 
      cyclosporine TDM, it is compromised by a limited analytical range and lack of 
      selectivity for parent drug. Here, we present the validation of an LC-MS 
      procedure that is equally applicable to use on single or tandem quadrupole 
      instruments. An extensive method comparison with FPIA was performed using samples 
      (n = 726) collected for full 12-hour pharmacokinetic studies on 121 renal 
      transplant recipients. Patients were receiving either full-dose cyclosporine or 
      primary sirolimus therapy complimented with low-dose cyclosporine. FPIA 
      overestimated all cyclosporine concentrations to varying degrees depending on 
      hour of collection (12 approximately 0 > 8 > 6 > 4 > 2-hour). The mean FPIA/LC-MS 
      ratio was significantly higher at 0 hour in the presence of sirolimus (P = 0.008) 
      and trended higher at the other collection times and for area under the curve. 
      Sirolimus also had a significant effect on the FPIA/LC-MS ratio at 12 hour in 
      studies with tmax at 2 hours (P = 0.042) but not 4 hours (P = 0.735). Use of 
      LC-MS procedures for cyclosporine TDM provides for quantitation of approximately 
      20% more samples from patients receiving low-dose cyclosporine and reduces any 
      errors in dosing that may occur because of the sirolimus effect on cyclosporine 
      pharmacokinetics when combined with varying degrees of overestimation of 
      cyclosporine concentrations by FPIA.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic variability of sirolimus in Taiwanese renal transplant 
      recipients.
PG  - 2058-9
AB  - To evaluate the pharmacokinetic variability of sirolimus (Rapamycin, SRL) in our 
      renal transplant (RTx) recipients, dose-normalized trough concentration (C(0)) of 
      SRL, and their intrasubject coefficients of variation (%CV) were analyzed. 
      Thirty-eight patients were enrolled in regimens containing SRL. Concomitant 
      immunosuppression included steroids (n = 38), cyclosporine (n = 33), tacrolimus 
      (n = 3), and mycophenolate mofetil (n = 7). The mean dose-normalized C(0) was 
      2.13 +/- 0.91 ng/mL/mg. The intrasubject %CV of the dose-normalized C(0) ranged 
      from 14% to 88% and averaged 42% in our series. The mean dose-normalized C(0) of 
      SRL in our RTx recipients was much lower than that reported in Phase III trials. 
      The intrasubject variation of dose-normalized C(0), even after administrating SRL 
      for 6 months, could still be quite prominent. Thus, we suggest that, to maintain 
      adequate therapeutic concentrations, periodic (monthly or bimonthly) SRL C(0) 
      measurement is necessary in Taiwanese (Oriental) patients receiving SRL.

TI  - Single-dose pharmacokinetics and tolerability of everolimus in stable pediatric 
      renal transplant patients.
PG  - 147-52
AB  - Everolimus (Certican; RAD), a novel macrolide with potent immunosuppressive and 
      anti-proliferative activities, prevents acute rejection in adult recipients of 
      renal transplantation. This phase I trial conducted in stable pediatric renal 
      transplant patients examined the single-dose pharmacokinetics, safety, and 
      tolerability of everolimus in combination with cyclosporin A (CsA; Neoral) and 
      corticosteroids, with or without azathioprine. Nineteen pediatric patients were 
      enrolled and received a single 1.2 mg/m2 dose of everolimus. Everolimus was safe 
      and well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events reported and none 
      judged to be related to the study medication. Everolimus administration did not 
      increase infection rates or produce clinically significant changes in vital signs 
      or changes in electrocardiograms. Apparent clearance and volume of distribution 
      of everolimus increased with age, weight, and body surface area in a generally 
      linear manner across the pediatric demographic ranges. Compared with adults from 
      a previous study, apparent clearance (L/h) and distribution volume (L) were lower 
      in pediatric patients, whereas the elimination half-life was similar. Single-dose 
      everolimus co-administration did not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of 
      CsA. Based on this information, pediatric patients will need a dose scaled down 
      for body size, but can probably maintain the same twice-daily dosing schedule 
      used in adults.

TI  - Therapeutic drug monitoring of cyclosporine Neoral in de novo Chinese cardiac 
      transplant recipients treated with an everolimus-cyclosporine immunosuppressive 
      regimen.
PG  - 2132-4
AB  - This study determined cyclosporine Neoral (CsA) pharmacokinetics and the accuracy 
      of a limited sampling strategy to predict the 12-hour CsA area-under-the-curve 
      (AUC) to provide a practical method for more accurate therapeutic drug monitor of 
      CsA among de novo Chinese heart transplant recipients treated with an 
      everolimus-CsA immunosuppressive regimen. METHODS: Blood samples were collected 
      at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after oral administration of CsA in 
      six de novo heart recipients receiving a CsA, everolimus, and methylprenisolone 
      immunosuppressive regimen after rabbit antithymoglobulin sequential 
      immuno-induction. We analyzed the pharmacokinetics of the first dose (PK-1) and 
      steady state dose (PK-2) at 1 month after transplantation. The accuracy of a 
      single-point sampling method to predict the AUC was generated by linear 
      regression analyses. RESULTS: The t(max) and dose-normalized C(max) of PK-1 and 
      PK-2 were similar. The correlations in single-point blood levels of PK-1 to 
      predict the AUC(0-infinity) were much lower than the corresponding sampling times 
      in PK-2. In PK-2 study, C4 had the best correlation (r(2) = 0.913, P = .003) to 
      predict AUC(0-12). In addition, the trough concentrations, C(0) (r(2) = 0.875, P 
      = .006) and C(12) (r(2) = 0.783, P = .02) also showed good correlations. C2 had 
      insufficient correlation to predict AUC(0-infinity) in PK-1 or AUC(0-12) in the 
      PK-2 study. In conclusion, the absorption of CsA was similar during PK-1 and 
      PK-2. At steady dose, C4 had the best single-point correlation to predict 
      AUC(0-12). Trough blood levels may be more practical in clinical use to monitor 
      CsA.

LID - 10.1007/s10637-021-01131-4 [doi]
AB  - Purpose This study investigated the relationship between the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of everolimus in patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC) in 
      real-world practice.Methods Twenty-two patients with mBC treated with everolimus 
      plus exemestane were enrolled. Blood everolimus concentrations were measured at 
      outpatient visits. The inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
      activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was examined. The efficacy 
      and safety endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and the cumulative 
      incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), respectively. Results Blood samples 
      were obtained from 19 consenting patients. Everolimus did not completely inhibit 
      mTOR activity in PBMCs at therapeutic concentrations (~ 56 % maximal inhibition). 
      The most common adverse event was stomatitis (any grade 77 %). The trough 
      concentration (C(trough)) was significantly higher in patients experiencing DLTs 
      than in those without any DLTs (P = 0.030). The optimal C(trough) cutoff 
      predicting DLT development was 17.3 ng/mL. The cumulative incidence of DLTs was 
      significantly higher in patients with C(trough) ≥17.3 ng/mL than in other 
      patients (sub-hazard ratio 4.87, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.53-15.5; 
      P = 0.007). Furthermore, the median PFS was numerically longer in patients who 
      maintained a steady-state C(trough) below the threshold than in those who did not 
      (327 days [95 % CI 103-355 days] vs. 194 days [95 % CI 45 days-not estimable]; 
      P = 0.35). Conclusions The suggested upper threshold for the therapeutic window 
      of everolimus C(trough) was 17.3 ng/mL. Pharmacokinetically guided dosing may 
      improve the efficacy and safety of everolimus for mBC, warranting further 
      investigation in a larger study.Clinical trial registry: Not applicable.

TI  - Evaluation of 6β-Hydroxycortisol and 6β-Hydroxycortisone as Biomarkers for 
      Cytochrome P450 3A Activity: Insight into Their Predictive Value for Estimating 
      Oral Immunosuppressant Metabolism.
PG  - 3578-86
LID - 10.1002/jps.24566 [doi]
AB  - The combined clearance of endogenous 6β-hydroxycortisol and 6β-hydroxycortisone 
      is suggested biomarker for in vivo cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) activity. We aimed 
      to determine whether the combined clearance of these two markers together with 
      information of biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) of drugs could be 
      used to predict CYP3A-mediated metabolism of immunosuppressants. The BCS of drug 
      formulations were determined based on the solubility and permeability. 
      Sixty-seven healthy subjects were divided into three groups and group 1 (n = 23), 
      2 (n = 22), and 3 (n = 22) received oral single dose of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, 
      and sirolimus, respectively. Blood and urine samples were gathered at various 
      times. The combined clearance of 6β-hydroxycortisol and 6β-hydroxycortisone 
      correlated significantly with cyclosporine pharmacokinetics (p < 0.001) after 
      oral dose of a BCS 1 formulation, whereas no relationships were seen after 
      administration of tacrolimus and sirolimus formulations, both of which belonged 
      to BCS 2. Regarding the biopharmaceutical characteristics, the endogenous CYP3A 
      biomarker explains 74.5% of variability in oral cyclosporine clearance between 
      individuals.

AB  - CYP3A5 and ABCB1 polymorphisms have been shown to influence tacrolimus blood 
      concentrations and dose requirements, but the conclusion in the current reports 
      were inconformity. Sirolimus are also metabolized by CYP3A subfamily and are 
      substrates of the P-gp. The aim was to determine whether these polymorphisms 
      affect tacrolimus (TAC) and sirolimus (SRL) trough concentrations and dose 
      requirements after renal transplantation. 153 renal transplant recipients were 
      enrolled into this study, 112 were treated with TAC-based regimen, Another 43 
      recipients received SRL-based regimen. The recipients' mean follow-up time was 20 
      mo (range 15-27 mo). All renal transplant recipients were all in a stable stage. 
      The trough concentration and daily dose of TAC and SRL were gained from each 
      recipient. All recipients were genotyped for CYP3A5 (6986A>G), CYP3A4 intron 6 
      (CYP3A4*22), CYP3A4*18, ABCB1 exon 26 (3435C>T), exon 12 (1236C>T) and 2677G>T/A 
      SNPs by HRM analysis (high-resolution melting curve analysis). The TAC and SRL 
      concentration/dose ratio (C/D) in recipients with CYP3A5 (*)3/(*)3 were 
      significantly higher than that of those with (*)1 allele (P < 0.05). However, 
      there was no significant correlation between adjusted TAC and SRL trough 
      concentrations or dose requirements with CYP3A4 and ABCB1 SNPs genetic 
      polymorphisms. In recipients with TAC-based or SRL-based therapy, 
      the CYP3A5 genes (6986A>G) can influence the TAC and SRL pharmacokinetics in 
      renal transplant recipients.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of everolimus in patients with renal 
      angiomyolipoma and tuberous sclerosis complex or lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
PG  - 958-70
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12834 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The purpose was to determine the exposure-response relationship of 
      everolimus in patients with angiomyolipoma from the EXIST-2 trial and to analyze 
      the correlation between exposure and plasma concentrations of angiogenic 
      biomarkers in these patients. METHODS: One hundred and eighteen patients with 
      angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) or sporadic 
      lymphangioleiomyomatosis (sLAM) were randomly assigned 2 : 1 to receive 
      everolimus 10 mg (n = 79) or placebo (n = 39) once daily. Blood samples for 
      determining everolimus concentration were collected at weeks 2, 4, 12, 24 and 48 
      during double-blind treatment. Plasma samples for biomarker analysis were 
      collected at baseline and weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, 48 and at the end of treatment. 
      Concentrations of eight angiogenic biomarkers associated with tumour growth were 
      determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Peak and trough 
      concentrations of everolimus in blood remained stable over time and similar to 
      those reported in other indications. Substantial pharmacodynamic effects were 
      observed in the everolimus, but not placebo, arm for three biomarkers: After 
      24 weeks of treatment, reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) 
      and collagen type IV (COL-IV) (mean fold-changes with 95% confidence intervals 
      [CI] were 0.36 [0.33, 0.40], and 0.54 [0.51, 0.57], respectively, P < 0.001 for 
      both), along with increased VEGF-A (mean fold-change of 1.59 [1.39, 1.80], 
      P < 0.001), were seen. Furthermore, baseline VEGF-D and COL-IV levels were 
      associated with angiomyolipoma size at baseline and with angiomyolipoma response 
      to everolimus. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that plasma angiogenic markers 
      may provide an objective measure of patient response to everolimus.

AB  - An oral formulation of temsirolimus (Torisel), an inhibitor of the mammalian 
      target of rapamycin, was evaluated on an intermittent schedule (once daily for 5 
      days every 2 weeks) in patients with advanced cancer. The maximum tolerated dose 
      was determined to be 75 mg after dose-limiting toxicities of grade 3 elevated 
      aminotransferases (1 patient) and grade 3 rash (1 patient) occurred with a 100-mg 
      dose. The most common temsirolimus-related adverse events were mucositis, 
      rash/maculopapular rash, and asthenia. Six of 12 patients who received the 75-mg 
      dose required dose reductions due to temsirolimus-related adverse events. Two 
      patients who received 75-mg temsirolimus and did not have dose reductions had 
      minor tumor responses. Relative exposure from contributions of both temsirolimus 
      and sirolimus, the principal metabolite, was 17.9% of the 75-mg dose. Thus, oral 
      temsirolimus, 75 mg administered once daily for 5 days every 2 weeks, was further 
      evaluated in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics and therapeutic drug monitoring of sirolimus.
PG  - B101-121
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is a novel macrocyclic antibiotic that has an 
      immunosuppressive mechanism of action distinct from that of cyclosporine and 
      tacrolimus. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this report is to provide an overview of 
      the clinical development of sirolimus with emphasis on the mechanism of 
      immunosuppressive activity, prevention of acute renal allograft rejection, 
      clinical pharmacokinetics, concentration-effect relationships, and therapeutic 
      drug monitoring (TDM). RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic studies in adult renal transplant 
      patients have shown that sirolimus may be characterized as a drug with rapid 
      absorption (t(max) = 1 to 2 hours), low systemic availability (F = 14%), linear 
      dose proportionality (2 to 24 mg), extensive partitioning into formed blood 
      elements (B/P = 36), large apparent volume of distribution (1.7 L/kg), prolonged 
      terminal half-life (62 hours), and large intersubject (CV = 52%) and intrasubject 
      (CV = 26%) variability in oral-dose clearance. Results from phase 111 pivotal 
      trials showed that sirolimus (2 or 5 mg/d) reduced acute renal graft rejection 
      (generally, P < 0.01) without TDM. Although TDM may not be required for a regimen 
      consisting of full-dose cyclosporine and corticosteroids with sirolimus 2 mg/d (4 
      hours after cyclosporine), it may be warranted in patients (1) with hepatic 
      impairment, (2) who are young children, (3) who are receiving concurrent doses of 
      strong CYP3A/p-glycoprotein inhibitors or inducers, (4) in whom cyclosporine 
      dosing is markedly reduced or discontinued, and (5) who are at a high risk for 
      rejection. A whole-blood sirolimus therapeutic window of 5 to 15 ng/mL (measured 
      by microparticle enzyme immunoassay) is recommended for patients at standard risk 
      of rejection. The large intrapatient variability observed in trough sirolimus 
      concentrations indicates that dose adjustments should be optimally based on more 
      than a single trough sample. Because of the time required to reach steady state, 
      sirolimus dose adjustments would optimally be based on trough levels obtained >5 
      to 7 days after a dose change. CONCLUSIONS: The effective use of sirolimus in an 
      immunosuppressive regimen for the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection 
      requires an understanding of the drug's clinical pharmacokinetics, 
      concentration/adverse-effect relationship, concentration-efficacy relationship, 
      and TDM.

TI  - Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of everolimus (RAD001) in 
      rats involving non-linear tissue uptake.
PG  - 373-400
AB  - Everolimus is a novel macrolide immunosuppressant developed for the prophylaxis 
      of allogeneic renal or cardiac transplant rejection. Treatments with 
      immunosuppressants are often associated with organ toxicity that is linked to 
      high organ exposure. Therefore, gaining insight into the pharmacokinetics of 
      everolimus in various organs is highly desirable especially those organs of 
      therapeutic interest or those that pose safety concerns. The aim of this work was 
      to characterize the disposition kinetics of everolimus in rats by physiologically 
      based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. Blood and tissue samples were collected 
      from male Wistar rats over 24 hr following intravenous (iv) bolus and iv infusion 
      of 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg/2 hr of everolimus. Further blood samples were collected 
      between 1 and 170 hr from a third group of rats, which received iv infusion of 1 
      mg/kg/2 hr of everolimus. Drug concentrations in blood and tissues were 
      determined by a liquid chromatography reverse dilution method. Distribution of 
      everolimus between blood fractions was determined in vitro at 37 degrees C. The 
      results of the study demonstrated that everolimus exhibited moderate non-linear 
      binding to red blood cells. Also, the tissue-to-blood concentration ratio 
      decreased in all tissues as blood concentration increased. A PBPK model involving 
      non-linear tissue binding was able to successfully describe the observed data in 
      blood and all the organs investigated. The highest binding potential was observed 
      in thymus, lungs, and spleen with the greatest tissue affinity observed in 
      thymus, skin, and muscle as compared to other tissues. Everolimus exhibited a 
      high clearance rate that was limited to the hepatic blood flow (47.2 ml/min/kg). 
      The PBPK model was also able to predict the venous blood concentration reasonably 
      well following oral administration. The oral bioavailability value, as estimated 
      with the PBPK, was 12% and was similar to the value obtained by non-compartmental 
      analysis. In conclusion, A PBPK model has been developed that successfully 
      predicts the time course of everolimus in blood and a variety of organs. This 
      model takes into account the non- linear binding of everolimus to red blood cells 
      and tissues. This model may be used to predict everolimus concentration-time 
      course in organs from other species including humans.

      ABCB1, and CYP3A5 polymorphisms.
PG  - 686-94
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0b013e318273c899 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was, using routine drug monitoring data, to 
      identify patient characteristics that may influence everolimus (EVE) 
      pharmacokinetic parameters and to develop a population pharmacokinetic model to 
      predict EVE whole blood concentrations in cardiac recipients. METHODS: Fifty-nine 
      patients were enrolled in the prospective study. Patient's characteristics were 
      recorded including biological covariates and treatments. CYP3A5 and ABCB1 
      polymorphisms were determined. Seven hundred seventy-five EVE blood samples were 
      collected for routine drug monitoring. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was 
      carried out using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling program. Results were 
      analyzed according to a 1-compartment pharmacokinetic model with linear 
      absorption and elimination. The model was evaluated using a bootstrap method and 
      a visual predictive check procedure. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic of EVE in 
      cardiac recipients was best described by a 1-compartment model. Interindividual 
      variability was best described by an exponential error model and residual error 
      by a proportional plus additive error model. Estimation of EVE apparent clearance 
      (3.33 ± 0.20 L/h) and apparent volume of distribution (146 ± 33 L) were in 
      accordance with previously published data. Bilirubinemia and cyclosporine 
      significantly influenced EVE clearance. Some covariates that were expected to 
      influence EVE clearance, for example, ABCB1 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms, were not 
      evidenced. No covariates influenced the volume of distribution of EVE. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first population pharmacokinetic model of EVE in 
      heart transplantation patients. It allows a better description of the 
      pharmacokinetics of EVE. The present population pharmacokinetic model allows 
      estimating a priori and a posteriori EVE concentrations in cardiac recipients and 
      could limit the over and under drug exposure in this population.

TI  - Reduced sirolimus systemic exposure and improved bioresorbable polymer 
      properties: new allies for the treatment of patients with coronary artery 
      disease.
PG  - 95-105
LID - 10.1111/fcp.12092 [doi]
AB  - This prospective, first-in-man, open-label multicenter study sought to assess the 
      pharmacokinetics of sirolimus after Ultimaster drug-eluting stent implantation 
      (coated with sirolimus and bioabsorbable co-polymer) in patients with de novo 
      coronary artery disease (the TCD-10023 PK study). The primary endpoint was 
      sirolimus concentration in peripheral whole blood at 28 days after stent 
      implantation. In addition, safety, tolerability, therapeutic outcome and 
      vasomotor response after stent implantation were studied. Twenty patients were 
      enrolled in the study. Blood samples for the measurements of sirolimus 
      concentration were collected at eight time points during first 48 h, at 7 days 
      and 28 days after stent implantation. Patients underwent 6-month angiographic and 
      up to 12 months clinical follow-up. At 28 days, only two of 20 patients had 
      sirolimus concentrations above lower limit of quantification (20.0 pg/mL). The 
      highest sirolimus blood concentration was 105 pg/mL. The median maximum 
      concentration was 36.8 pg/mL (range 22.9-41.5 pg/mL) for stent 3.0 × 15 mm and 
      87.2 pg/mL (range 60.0-105.0 pg/mL) for 3 × 28 mm stent. The median systemic 
      exposure, as measured by the area under the time-concentration curve, was 
      8.3 ng h/mL (range 6.47-28.0 ng h/mL). At 6 months, endothelial function was well 
      preserved, and up to 12 months, there were no signs of sirolimus toxicity nor any 
      other safety concerns. Our results demonstrate that implantation of Ultimaster 
      stent resulted in almost nondetectable sirolimus in blood after 28 days. These 
      findings were translated into exceptional safety profile, without any sign of 
      systemic toxicity.

AB  - We conducted a phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
      clofarabine with high-dose busulfan followed by allogeneic stem cell 
      transplantation (SCT) in patients with high-risk and refractory acute leukemia. 
      Patients received intravenous busulfan 0.8 mg/kg every 6 h on days -6 to -3 and 
      clofarabine 30-60 mg/m(2) per day on days -6 to -2. Graft-versus-host disease 
      prophylaxis included sirolimus plus tacrolimus (days -2 to +180). A total of 15 
      patients, median age 48 (30-58) years, with acute leukemia that was relapsed and 
      refractory (n=8), primary refractory (n=6), or in CR2 (n=1), were treated at four 
      clofarabine dose levels: 30 (n=3), 40 (n=3), 50 (n=3) and 60 mg/m(2) per day 
      (n=6) with busulfan. All engrafted, and the MTD was not reached. Grades 3-4 
      non-hematological toxicities included vomiting (n=3), mucositis (n=9), hand-foot 
      syndrome (n=1), acute renal failure (n=1) and reversible elevation of aspartate 
      aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (n=10). The 1-year event-free survival 
      was 53% (95% confidence interval: 33-86%), and the 1-year overall survival was 
      60% (95% confidence interval: 40-91%). Given the good tolerability and promising 
      results, we recommend clofarabine 60 mg/m(2) per day × 5 days as a phase II dose 
      in combination with busulfan (12.8 mg per kg total dose) for further study as a 
      myeloablative regimen for allogeneic SCT for high-risk acute leukemia.

TI  - Phase I study of temsirolimus in pediatric patients with recurrent/refractory 
      solid tumors.
PG  - 2933-40
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2010.33.4649 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine dose-limiting toxicities, maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), 
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of weekly intravenous temsirolimus, a 
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway inhibitor, in pediatric 
      patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cohorts 
      of three to six patients 1 to 21 years of age with recurrent or refractory solid 
      tumors were treated with a 1-hour intravenous infusion of temsirolimus weekly for 
      3 weeks per course at one of four dose levels: 10, 25, 75, or 150 mg/m(2). During 
      the first two courses, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations 
      (phosphorylation of S6, AKT, and 4EBP1 in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells) 
      were performed. RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 anorexia) occurred in 
      one of 18 evaluable patients at the 150 mg/m(2) level, which was determined to be 
      tolerable, and an MTD was not identified. In 13 patients evaluable for response 
      after two courses of therapy, one had complete response (CR; neuroblastoma) and 
      five had stable disease (SD). Four patients (three SDs + one CR) remained on 
      treatment for more than 4 months. The sum of temsirolimus and sirolimus areas 
      under the concentration-time curve was comparable to values in adults. AKT and 
      4EBP1 phosphorylation were inhibited at all dose levels, particularly after two 
      courses. CONCLUSION: Weekly intravenous temsirolimus is well tolerated in 
      children with recurrent solid tumors, demonstrates antitumor activity, has 
      pharmacokinetics similar to those in adults, and inhibits the mTOR signaling 
      pathway in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. Further studies are needed to 
      define the optimal dose for use in combination with other antineoplastic agents 
      in pediatric patients.

TI  - Phase 1 trial of everolimus and gefitinib in patients with advanced nonsmall-cell 
      lung cancer.
PG  - 599-605
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the inhibition of the 
      PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway restores gefitinib sensitivity in resistant cancer cell 
      lines. A phase 1 study was conducted of the combination of everolimus, an mTOR 
      inhibitor, and gefitinib to determine a daily dose of everolimus with gefitinib 
      in patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Oral 
      everolimus and gefitinib were both administered daily to patients with 
      progressive NSCLC. Patients were enrolled in 3-patient cohorts at everolimus dose 
      levels of 5 and 10 mg daily. All patients received gefitinib 250 mg daily. 
      RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled. The maximum tolerated dose of everolimus was 
      5 mg when administered daily with gefitinib 250 mg. Two patients who were treated 
      at the 10 mg dose level of everolimus experienced dose-limiting toxicity, 
      including grade 5 hypotension and grade 3 stomatitis. Pharmacokinetic studies 
      demonstrated no consistent, significant interaction on the t(max), C(max), and 
      AUC(0-8h) of either agent. Two partial radiographic responses were identified 
      among the 8 response-evaluable patients. CONCLUSIONS: For further study, 
      everolimus at a dose of 5 mg daily in combination with daily gefitinib 250 mg is 
      recommended. The 2 radiographic responses identified are encouraging. A phase 2 
      trial in patients with NSCLC is under way.

TI  - A Single-Arm Phase 1b Study of Everolimus and Sunitinib in Patients With Advanced 
      Renal Cell Carcinoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Everolimus, an oral inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin 
      (mTOR), and sunitinib, an oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (VEGF)/platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, have 
      both been shown to provide clinical benefit in patients with advanced renal cell 
      carcinoma (RCC). We sought to determine the safety and efficacy of combination 
      therapy with these agents in patients with advanced RCC. METHODS: We conducted a 
      phase 1b dose escalation trial of sunitinib and everolimus in patients with 
      advanced metastatic RCC. Prior nephrectomy was required, and prior radiation or 
      chemotherapy other than VEGF/mTOR-based therapies was permitted. The primary end 
      point was to determine the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose. 
      RESULTS: A total of 4 out of a planned 30 subjects were enrolled onto this study 
      (M:F = 2:2; mean age 52 years, 50% with Karnofsky performance status < 80). The 
      first 3 patients were enrolled onto a 4 + 2 dosing schedule of daily sunitinib 50 
      mg and weekly everolimus 30 mg. Mean time receiving drug was 99 days. One partial 
      response was seen. Toxicities included mucositis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, 
      fatigue, dehydration, and hypoglycemia. Because of multiple grade 3 to 4 
      toxicities, the protocol was amended to 2 + 1 dosing of sunitinib 37.5 mg and 
      daily everolimus 5 mg. The first patient on this schedule died from multiorgan 
      failure with septic shock after 1 cycle of treatment. Subsequently, the study was 
      closed. Pharmacokinetic results inconclusively suggest that toxicities could be 
      attributed to the drug exposure. CONCLUSION: Combined use of everolimus and 
      sunitinib in the treatment of metastatic RCC was not well tolerated in this small 
      cohort.

PG  - 2997-3009
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S26546 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to improve the physicochemical properties 
      and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble sirolimus via preparation of a solid 
      dispersion of nanoparticles using a supercritical antisolvent (SAS) process. 
      METHODS: First, excipients for enhancing the stability and solubility of 
      sirolimus were screened. Second, using the SAS process, solid dispersions of 
      sirolimus-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30 nanoparticles were prepared with or 
      without surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), tocopheryl propylene 
      glycol succinate, Sucroester 15, Gelucire 50/13, and Myrj 52. A mean particle 
      size of approximately 250 nm was obtained for PVP K30-sirolimus nanoparticles. 
      Solid state characterization, kinetic solubility, powder dissolution, stability, 
      and pharmacokinetics were analyzed in rats. RESULTS: X-ray diffraction, 
      differential scanning calorimetry, and high-pressure liquid chromatography 
      indicated that sirolimus existed in an anhydrous amorphous form within a solid 
      dispersion of nanoparticles and that no degradation occurred after SAS 
      processing. The improved supersaturation and dissolution of sirolimus as a solid 
      dispersion of nanoparticles appeared to be well correlated with enhanced 
      bioavailability of oral sirolimus in rats. With oral administration of a solid 
      dispersion of PVP K30-SLS-sirolimus nanoparticles, the peak concentration and 
      AUC(0→12h) of sirolimus were increased by approximately 18.3-fold and 15.2-fold, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that preparation of 
      PVP K30-sirolimus-surfactant nanoparticles using the SAS process may be a 
      promising approach for improving the bioavailability of sirolimus.

      dose (RP2D) of pimasertib in combination with temsirolimus, safety and 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) were investigated. Results Of 33 patients evaluated, all 
      experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and 31 had 
      treatment-related TEAEs, most frequently stomatitis and thrombocytopenia. TEAEs 
      were reversible. No deaths were attributed to treatment. Nine patients had 
      dose-limiting toxicities (stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, serum creatinine 
      phosphokinase increase, visual impairment) and the MTD was determined as 
      45 mg/day pimasertib plus 25 mg/week temsirolimus. However, due to overlapping 
      toxicities no further investigations were performed and the RP2D was not defined. 
      PK profiles of both agents were not adversely affected. Seventeen patients (17/26 
      patients) had a best response of stable disease; five had stable disease lasting 
      >12 weeks. Conclusions The RP2D was not defined and the pimasertib plus 
      temsirolimus combination investigated did not warrant further study.

TI  - Differential influence of two cyclosporine formulations on everolimus 
      pharmacokinetics: a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction.
PG  - 95-9
AB  - Everolimus is an immunosuppressant intended for use with cyclosporine in 
      acute-rejection prophylaxis following organ transplantation. The possibility of a 
      drug interaction of cyclosporine on everolimus was assessed. In this randomized, 
      two-period, crossover study, 24 healthy subjects received a single oral dose of 2 
      mg everolimus alone and with one of two cyclosporine formulations: either 175 mg 
      Neoral or 300 mg Sandimmune. The single doses of Neoral and Sandimmune were 
      chosen to yield similar average areas under the concentration-time curve (AUC). 
      Treatments were separated by a 14-day washout period. Cyclosporine AUCs were 
      similar for both formulations (p = 0.53), whereas the peak concentration (Cmax) 
      was significantly higher for Neoral (p = 0.02). Simultaneous administration of 
      Neoral with everolimus increased everolimus Cmax and AUC by 82% and 168%, 
      respectively (p = 0.0001). Coadministration of Sandimmune with everolimus did not 
      affect everolimus Cmax (p = 0.59) but increased everolimus AUC by 74% on average 
      (p = 0.0001). Everolimus elimination half-lives were unchanged in the presence of 
      both cyclosporine formulations. The everolimus AUC increase with Neoral 
      coadministration was significantly greater than the AUC increase with Sandimmune 
      (p = 0.008). However, there was no apparent association between cyclosporine Cmax 
      and the change in everolimus AUC with cyclosporine coadministration. If Neoral or 
      Sandimmune is removed from an everolimus-cyclosporine immunosuppressive regimen, 
      a two- to three-fold decrease in everolimus exposure is expected. Therapeutic 
      monitoring of everolimus concentrations would be helpful after the removal of 
      cyclosporine to individually titrate everolimus exposure.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interaction between everolimus and antifungal triazoles in a 
      liver transplant patient.
PG  - 1711-6
LID - 10.1345/aph.1L330 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the management of a pharmacokinetic interaction between 
      azole antifungals (fluconazole and voriconazole) and everolimus in a patient who 
      underwent an orthotopic liver transplant. CASE SUMMARY: A 65-year-old male who 
      received an orthotopic liver transplant experienced an iatrogenic retroperitoneal 
      duodenal perforation on postoperative day 55. His condition was subsequently 
      complicated by severe sepsis and acute renal failure. Intravenous fluconazole 400 
      mg, followed by 100 mg every 24 hours according to impaired renal function, was 
      immediately started; to avoid further nephrotoxicity, immunosuppressant therapy 
      was switched from cyclosporine plus mycophenolate mofetil to oral everolimus 0.75 
      mg every 12 hours. Satisfactory steady-state minimum concentration (C(min)) of 
      everolimus was achieved (approximately 5 ng/mL). On day 72 posttransplant, 
      because of invasive aspergillosis, antifungal therapy was switched to intravenous 
      voriconazole 400 mg every 12 hours on the first day, followed by 200 mg every 12 
      hours; to prevent drug toxicity, the everolimus dosage was promptly lowered to 
      0.25 mg every 24 hours. At that time, the everolimus C(min) averaged 
      approximately 3 ng/mL. The concentration/dose ratio of everolimus (ie, C(min) 
      reached at steady-state for each milligram per kilogram of drug administered) was 
      markedly lower during fluconazole versus voriconazole cotreatment (mean +/- SD, 
      3.49 +/- 0.29 vs 11.05 +/- 0.81 ng/mL per mg/kg/daily; p < 0.001). Despite 
      intensive care, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate and he died on 
      day 84 posttransplant. DISCUSSION: Both azole antifungals were considered 
      probable causative agents of an interaction with everolimus according to the Drug 
      Interaction Probability Scale. The interaction is due to the inhibition of 
      CYP3A4-mediated everolimus clearance. Of note, prompt reduction of the everolimus 
      dosage since the first azole coadministration, coupled with intensive therapeutic 
      drug monitoring, represented a useful strategy to prevent drug overexposure. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that during everolimus-azole cotreatment, a dose 
      reduction of everolimus is needed to avoid overexposure. According to the 
      different inhibitory potency of CYP3A4 activity, the reduction should be lower 
      during fluconazole than during voriconazole cotreatment.

TI  - Sirolimus population pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenetic analysis and bayesian 
      modelling in kidney transplant recipients.
PG  - 1135-48
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present study were: (i) to analyse the 
      population pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in renal transplant recipients 
      co-administered mycophenolate mofetil, but no calcineurin inhibitor over the 
      first 3 months post-transplantation and study the influence of different 
      potential covariates, including genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
      metabolic enzymes and active transporters, on pharmacokinetic parameters; and 
      (ii) to develop a Bayesian estimator able to reliably estimate the individual 
      pharmacokinetic parameters and exposure indices in this population. METHODS: 
      Twenty-two adult renal transplant patients treated with sirolimus participated in 
      this study. Ninety concentration-time profiles (938 sirolimus whole blood 
      samples) were collected at days 7 and 14, and months 1 and 3 
      post-transplantation. The population pharmacokinetic study was conducted using 
      the nonlinear mixed effects model software, NONMEM, and validated using both the 
      bootstrap and the cross-validation approaches. Finally, a Bayesian estimator 
      based on a limited sampling strategy was built using the post hoc option. 
      RESULTS: A two-compartment open model with first-order elimination and Erlang's 
      distribution (to describe the absorption phase) best fitted the data. The mean 
      pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were 5.25 h(-1), 218L and 292L for the 
      transfer rate constant, the apparent volume of the central and peripheral 
      compartments, respectively. The CYP3A5*1/*3 polymorphism significantly influenced 
      the apparent oral clearance: mean oral clearance = 14.1 L/h for CYP3A5 non 
      expressers (CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype) versus 28.3 L/h for CYP3A5 expressers 
      (CYP3A5*1/*3 and *1/*1 genotypes). The standard errors of all the parameter 
      estimates were <15%. Maximum a posteriori Bayesian forecasting allowed accurate 
      prediction of sirolimus area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 
      hours using a combination of only three sampling times (0, 1 and 3 hours 
      post-dose), with a non-significant bias of -2.1% (range -22.2% to +25.9%), and a 
      good precision (root mean square error = 10.3%). This combination is also easy to 
      implement in clinical practice. CONCLUSION: This study presents an accurate 
      population pharmacokinetic model showing the significant influence of the 
      CYP3A5*1/*3 polymorphism on sirolimus apparent oral clearance, and a Bayesian 
      estimator accurately predicting sirolimus pharmacokinetics in patients 
      co-administered mycophenolate mofetil, but no calcineurin inhibitor.

PG  - 1673-82
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S43299 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to develop an optimized solid 
      self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) formulation for sirolimus to 
      enhance its solubility, stability, and bioavailability. METHODS: Excipients used 
      for enhancing the solubility and stability of sirolimus were screened. A 
      phase-separation test, visual observation for emulsifying efficiency, and droplet 
      size analysis were performed. Ternary phase diagrams were constructed to optimize 
      the liquid SMEDDS formulation. The selected liquid SMEDDS formulations were 
      prepared into solid form. The dissolution profiles and pharmacokinetic profiles 
      in rats were analyzed. RESULTS: In the results of the oil and cosolvent screening 
      studies, Capryol™ Propylene glycol monocapry late (PGMC) and glycofurol exhibited 
      the highest solubility of all oils and cosolvents, respectively. In the 
      surfactant screening test, D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate 
      (vitamin E TPGS) was determined to be the most effective stabilizer of sirolimus 
      in pH 1.2 simulated gastric fluids. The optimal formulation determined by the 
      construction of ternary phase diagrams was the T32 (Capryol™ 
      PGMC:glycofurol:vitamin E TPGS = 30:30:40 weight ratio) formulation with a mean 
      droplet size of 108.2 ± 11.4 nm. The solid SMEDDS formulations were prepared with 
      Sucroester 15 and mannitol. The droplet size of the reconstituted solid SMEDDS 
      showed no significant difference compared with the liquid SMEDDS. In the 
      dissolution study, the release amounts of sirolimus from the SMEDDS formulation 
      were significantly higher than the raw sirolimus powder. In addition, the solid 
      SMEDDS formulation was in a more stable state than liquid SMEDDS in pH 1.2 
      simulated gastric fluids. The results of the pharmacokinetic study indicate that 
      the SMEDDS formulation shows significantly greater bioavailability than the raw 
      sirolimus powder or commercial product (Rapamune® oral solution). CONCLUSION: The 
      results of this study suggest the potential use of a solid SMEDDS formulation for 
      the delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs, such as sirolimus, through oral 
      administration.

TI  - Everolimus in combination with pemetrexed in patients with advanced non-small 
      cell lung cancer previously treated with chemotherapy: a phase I study using a 
      novel, adaptive Bayesian dose-escalation model.
PG  - 2120-9
LID - 10.1097/JTO.0b013e3182307ede [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pemetrexed is an established second-line therapy for non-small cell 
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Everolimus has previously been shown to have some clinical 
      activity when used as a single agent in NSCLC. The aim of this phase I study was 
      to evaluate the safety and feasibility of combining pemetrexed with everolimus in 
      patients with NSCLC who had disease progression after one previous treatment. 
      METHODS: Patients with stage IIIb/IV NSCLC and one previous chemotherapy regimen 
      were enrolled. A Bayesian dose-escalation model was used to determine the 
      feasible doses of daily or weekly everolimus combined with pemetrexed (500 mg/m 
      q3w). The primary end point was rate of cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). 
      Secondary end points included safety, relative dose intensity of pemetrexed, 
      pharmacokinetics, and tumor response. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients received 
      daily everolimus (2.5, 5, 7.5, or 10 mg) and 19 received weekly everolimus (30 or 
      50 mg) with pemetrexed. Cycle 1 DLTs in the daily regimen included febrile 
      neutropenia, neutropenia, rash/pruritus, and thrombocytopenia; in the weekly 
      regimen, DLTs included neutropenia and stomatitis. The most frequent grade 3/4 
      adverse events were neutropenia, dyspnea, and thrombocytopenia. Three partial 
      responses were observed with everolimus 5 mg/d and two with 50 mg/wk. 
      Pharmacokinetics did not suggest an influence of everolimus on pemetrexed 
      parameters; pemetrexed resulted in a minor decrease in everolimus exposure with 
      both daily and weekly regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus 5 mg/d or 50 mg/wk with 
      the standard regimen of pemetrexed are feasible dosages in patients with stage 
      IIIb/IV NSCLC.

TI  - A phase I study of mTOR inhibitor everolimus in association with cisplatin and 
      radiotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced cervix cancer: PHOENIX I.
PG  - 101-9
LID - 10.1007/s00280-016-3064-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervix cancer (CC) represents the fourth most common cancer in women. 
      Treatment involving cisplatin and radiotherapy has been the standard for locally 
      advanced disease. Everolimus inhibits the aberrant activity of mTOR that is part 
      of carcinogenesis in CC. Further everolimus inactivates the HPV E7 oncoprotein 
      and inhibits its proliferation. Preclinical models have suggested that everolimus 
      sensitizes tumoral cells and vasculature to cisplatin and radiotherapy. METHODS: 
      In a 3 + 3 design, the trial aimed to treat three dose levels of at least three 
      patients with daily doses of everolimus (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/day), cisplatin and 
      radiotherapy delivered in a 9-week interval in CC patients, stage IIB, IIIA or 
      IIIB. Patients received everolimus from day -7 up to the last day of 
      brachytherapy. Primary objective was to evaluate safety, toxicity and the 
      maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of everolimus in association with cisplatin and 
      radiotherapy. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and response rates were analyzed as 
      secondary objectives. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled, 6 at 2.5 mg, 3 at 
      5 mg and 4 at 10 mg. Four patients did not complete the planned schedule, 1 at 
      2.5 mg presented grade 4 acute renal failure interpreted as dose-limiting 
      toxicity (DLT) and 3 at 10 mg: 1 with disease progression, and 2 with DLTs-1 
      grade 3 rash and 1 grade 4 neutropenia. PK results were characterized by 
      dose-dependent increases in AUC and C max. CONCLUSIONS: The MTD of everolimus in 
      combination with cisplatin and radiotherapy has been defined as 5 mg/day. The 
      data regarding safety and response rates support further studies.

TI  - Blood concentrations of everolimus are markedly increased by ketoconazole.
PG  - 514-8
AB  - The authors sought to quantify the influence of the CYP3A and P-glycoprotein 
      inhibitor ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of everolimus in healthy subjects. 
      This was a 2-period, single-sequence, crossover study in 12 healthy subjects. In 
      period 1, subjects received the reference treatment of a single 2-mg dose of 
      everolimus. In period 2, they received the test treatment of ketoconazole 200 mg 
      twice daily for a total of 8 days and a single dose of everolimus coadministered 
      on the fourth day of ketoconazole therapy. The test/reference ratio and 90% 
      confidence interval were derived for everolimus maximum concentration and area 
      under the curve. During ketoconazole coadministration, everolimus maximum 
      concentration increased 3.9-fold (90% confidence interval, 3.4-4.6) from 15 +/- 4 
      ng/mL to 59 +/- 13 ng/mL. Everolimus area under the curve increased 15.0-fold 
      (90% confidence interval, 13.6-16.6) from 90 +/- 23 ng*h/mL to 1324 +/- 232 
      ng*h/mL. Everolimus half-life was prolonged by 1.9-fold from 30 +/- 4 hours to 56 
      +/- 5 hours. Everolimus did not appear to alter ketoconazole predose 
      concentrations. Given the magnitude of this drug interaction, use of ketoconazole 
      should be avoided if possible in everolimus-treated patients.

TI  - A phase Ib trial of LY2584702 tosylate, a p70 S6 inhibitor, in combination with 
      erlotinib or everolimus in patients with solid tumours.

LID - S0959-8049(13)01071-X [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: LY2584702 tosylate (hereafter referred to as LY2584702) is an oral, 
      selective ATP competitive inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase. Preclinical studies with 
      LY2584702 demonstrated significant synergistic activity with erlotinib and 
      everolimus. The primary objective was to determine a phase II dose and schedule. 
      Secondary objectives included evaluation of safety, toxicity and pharmacokinetics 
      of LY2584702 in combination with erlotinib or everolimus. METHODS: Patients with 
      advanced solid tumours were treated with a total daily dose of 50-200mg of 
      LY2584702 in combination with erlotinib 150 mg once daily (Arm A) or everolimus 
      10mg once daily (Arm B). Dose escalation was based on 3+3 design and used the 
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0. RESULTS: Twenty-nine 
      patients were enrolled, 17 in Arm A and 12 in Arm B. Dose limiting toxicities 
      (DLTs) in cycle 1 were observed in Arm A in four patients and consisted of Grade 
      3 vomiting, hypophosphataemia, pulmonary embolism and decreased clotting factor 
      V. No DLTs were observed in Arm B at cycle 1, and the most frequent 
      treatment-emergent adverse events related to study drug were: fatigue, anorexia, 
      diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Seven patients received ≥4 cycles (3 in A, 4 in 
      B). Best overall response was stable disease. Exposure accumulation of LY2584702 
      occurred with BID (twice daily) dosing. Exposure of erlotinib increased when 
      administered in combination with LY2584702. CONCLUSION: LY2584702 was not well 
      tolerated when administered with erlotinib, therefore this combination is not 
      feasible. The combination with everolimus was better tolerated but yielded very 
      limited clinical benefit.

TI  - Everolimus for the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis: a phase II study.
PG  - 783-94
LID - 10.1183/09031936.00210714 [doi]
AB  - Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare, progressive cystic lung disorder 
      characterised by dysregulated activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
      signalling.This was a phase IIa, multicentre, open-label study of the mTOR 
      inhibitor everolimus (2.5 mg·day(-1) escalated to 10 mg·day(-1)) in 24 women with 
      lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Primary endpoints were safety, pharmacokinetics and 
      serum vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D) levels; secondary endpoints 
      were measures of lung function.Following 26 weeks of everolimus treatment, forced 
      vital capacity exhibited stability, while forced expiration volume in 1 s 
      improved from baseline, with mean changes (95% confidence interval) of 10 mL 
      (-111-132) and 114 mL (11-217), respectively; 6-min walk distance improved by 
      47 m. Median VEGF-D and collagen IV levels decreased from baseline, from 
      1730 pg·mL(-1) to 934.5 pg·mL(-1), and 103 ng·mL(-1) to 80.5 ng·mL(-1), 
      respectively. Adverse events were mostly grade 1-2; mouth ulceration, headache, 
      nausea, stomatitis and fatigue were common. Serious adverse events suspected to 
      be treatment related included peripheral oedema, pneumonia, cardiac failure and 
      Pneumocystis jirovecii infection. Everolimus blood levels increased dose 
      proportionally.In this study, everolimus improved some measures of lung function 
      and exercise capacity and reduced serum VEGF-D and collagen IV. Side effects were 
      generally consistent with known toxicities of mTOR inhibitors, although some were 
      severe.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is increasingly investigated as a new targeted therapy in 
      pediatric populations. To date, population pharmacokinetic (PK) studies have 
      identified several factors that explain in part the large between-patient 
      variability in sirolimus PK. However, within-patient variability in sirolimus PK 
      is not well documented. This study presents examples of model-based PK-guided 
      dosing of sirolimus in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), where 
      patients experienced significant changes in sirolimus blood concentrations due to 
      infection and food intake during the treatment period. METHODS: Clinical PK data 
      were obtained as part of a prospective pilot study of sirolimus combined with 
      multiagent chemotherapy in pediatric patients with ALL (ClinicalTrial.gov 
      identifier: NCT01658007). A PK model-informed loading dose of 1.8 mg/m(2) every 
      8 h was started on the first day of sirolimus treatment. Subsequent doses were 
      adjusted based on concentration measurements the first blood draw scheduled 24 h 
      into the regimen on the morning of day 2. Sirolimus blood concentrations were 
      determined by a validated LC-MS/MS assay. All dosing recommendations were 
      generated in real time using the PK model with Bayesian estimation. RESULTS: 
      Three patients were enrolled in this study. Two patients achieved target 
      concentration attainment with the PK model-informed loading dose on day 1 of 
      sirolimus treatment. Subsequent unexpected high sirolimus concentrations were 
      observed in two patients, where patients had flulike symptoms such as fever and 
      cough. A sudden decrease in sirolimus concentrations was observed in one patient 
      after switching sirolimus administration from the fed to the fasting state. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights within-patient fluctuations in sirolimus 
      concentrations associated with intercurrent infection and with changes in diet. 
      These findings highlight the challenge of maintaining a target sirolimus 
      concentration as a patient's clinical status changes, and the benefit of 
      intensive monitoring of therapeutic drug levels in children treated with 
      sirolimus. Intra-patient alternations in sirolimus PK due to similar disease/food 
      interactions may be relevant in pediatric patients treated with sirolimus for 
      other disease indications.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Bioanalytical LC-MS/MS Method for Simultaneous

      Pharmacokinetic Application with Coronary Stents.

AB  - Sirolimus is a hydrophobic macrolide compound that has been used for long-term 
      immunosuppressive therapy, prevention of restenosis, and treatment of 
      lymphangioleiomyomatosis. In this study, a simple and sensitive liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed and validated 
      for the simultaneous determination of sirolimus in both porcine whole blood and 
      lung tissue. Blood and lung tissue homogenates were deproteinized with 
      acetonitrile and injected into the LC-MS/MS system for analysis using the 
      positive electrospray ionization mode. The drug was separated on a C18 reversed 
      phase column with a gradient mobile phase (ammonium formate buffer (5 mM) with 
      0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile) at 0.2 mL/min. The selected reaction 
      monitoring transitions of m/z 931.5 → 864.4 and m/z 809.5 → 756.5 were applied 
      for sirolimus and ascomycin (the internal standard, IS), respectively. The method 
      was selective and linear over a concentration range of 0.5-50 ng/mL. The method 
      was validated for sensitivity, accuracy, precision, extraction recovery, matrix 
      effect, and stability in porcine whole blood and lung tissue homogenates, and all 
      values were within acceptable ranges. The method was applied to a pharmacokinetic 
      study to quantitate sirolimus levels in porcine blood and its distribution in 
      lung tissue following the application of stents in the porcine coronary arteries. 
      It enabled the quantification of sirolimus concentration until 2 and 14 days in 
      blood and in lung tissue, respectively. This method would be appropriate for both 
      routine porcine pharmacokinetic and bio-distribution studies of sirolimus 
      formulations.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop supersaturatable formulations for the 
      enhanced solubility and oral absorption of sirolimus. Supersaturatable 
      formulations of hydrophilic polymers and/or surfactants were screened by 
      formulation screening, which is based on solvent casting. The solid dispersion 
      particles in the optimized formulations were prepared by spray drying. The 
      particles were characterized in vitro and in vivo. The most effective 
      supersaturatable formulation found in the formulation screening process was 
      hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC)-D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 
      succinate (TPGS), followed by HPMC-Sucroester. In addition, the supersaturated 
      state generated from HPMC-TPGS and HPMC-Sucroester 15 particles prepared by spray 
      drying significantly improved the oral absorption of sirolimus in rats. Based on 
      the pharmacokinetic parameters and supporting in vitro supersaturated dissolution 
      data, the enhanced supersaturation properties of sirolimus led to enhanced in 
      vivo oral absorption. In addition, the experimental results from the formulation 
      screening used in our study could be useful for enhancing the bioavailability of 
      sirolimus in preformulation and formulation studies.

TI  - Development of a predictive limited sampling strategy for estimation of 
      mycophenolic acid area under the concentration time curve in patients receiving 
      concomitant sirolimus or cyclosporine.

AB  - Limited sampling strategies for estimation of the area under the concentration 
      time curve (AUC) for mycophenolic acid (MPA) co-administered with sirolimus (SRL) 
      have not been previously evaluated. The authors developed and validated 68 
      regression models for estimation of MPA AUC for two groups of patients, one with 
      concomitant SRL (n = 24) and the second with concomitant cyclosporine (n=14), 
      using various combinations of time points between 0 and 4 hours after drug 
      administration. To provide as robust a model as possible, a dataset-splitting 
      method similar to a bootstrap was used. In this method, the dataset was randomly 
      split in half 100 times. Each time, one half of the data was used to estimate the 
      equation coefficients, and the other half was used to test and validate the 
      models. Final models were obtained by calculating the median values of the 
      coefficients. Substantial differences were found in the pharmacokinetics of MPA 
      between these groups. The mean MPA AUC as well as the standard deviation was much 
      greater in the SRL group, 56.4 +/- 23.5 mg.h/L, compared with 30.4 +/- 11.0 
      mg.h/L in the cyclosporine group (P < 0.001). Mean maximum concentration was also 
      greater in the SRL group: 16.4 +/- 7.7 mg/L versus 11.7 +/- 7.1mg/L (P < 0.005). 
      The second absorption peak in the pharmacokinetic profile, presumed to result 
      from enterohepatic recycling of glucuronide MPA, was observed in 70% of the 
      profiles in the SRL group and in 35% of profiles from the cyclosporine group. 
      Substantial differences in the predictive performance of the regression models, 
      based on the same time points, were observed between the two groups. The best 
      model for the SRL group was based on 0 (trough) and 40 minutes and 4 hour time 
      points with R2, root mean squared error, and predictive performance values of 
      0.82, 10.0, and 78%, respectively. In the cyclosporine group, the best model was 
      0 and 40 minutes and 2 hours, with R2, RMSE, and predictive performance values of 
      0.86, 4.1, and 83%, respectively. The model with 2 hours as the last time point 
      is also recommended for the SRL group for practical reasons, with the above 
      parameters of 0.77, 11.3, and 69%, respectively.

TI  - Model-Informed Precision Dosing of Everolimus: External Validation in Adult Renal 
      Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 191-203
LID - 10.1007/s40262-020-00925-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The immunosuppressant everolimus is increasingly 
      applied in renal transplantation. Its extensive pharmacokinetic variability 
      necessitates therapeutic drug monitoring, typically based on whole-blood trough 
      concentrations (C(0)). Unfortunately, therapeutic drug monitoring target 
      attainment rates are often unsatisfactory and patients with on-target exposure 
      may still develop organ rejection. As everolimus displays erythrocyte 
      partitioning, haematocrit-normalised whole-blood exposure has been suggested as a 
      more informative therapeutic drug monitoring marker. Furthermore, model-informed 
      precision dosing has introduced options for more sophisticated dose adaptation. 
      We have previously developed a mechanistic population pharmacokinetic model, 
      which described everolimus plasma pharmacokinetics and enabled estimation of 
      haematocrit-normalised whole-blood exposure. Here, we externally evaluated this 
      model for its utility for model-informed precision dosing. METHODS: The 
      retrospective dataset included 4123 pharmacokinetic observations from routine 
      clinical therapeutic drug monitoring in 173 renal transplant recipients. Model 
      appropriateness was confirmed with a visual predictive check. A fit-for-purpose 
      analysis was conducted to evaluate whether the model accurately and precisely 
      predicted a future C(0) or area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from 
      prior pharmacokinetic observations. Bias and imprecision were expressed as the 
      mean percentage prediction error (MPPE) and mean absolute percentage prediction 
      error (MAPE), stratified on 6 months post-transplant. Additionally, we compared 
      dose adaptation recommendations of conventional C(0)-based therapeutic drug 
      monitoring and C(0)- or AUC-based model-informed precision dosing, and assessed 
      the percentage of differences between observed and haematocrit-normalised C(0) 
      (∆C(0)) and AUC (∆AUC) exceeding ± 20%. RESULTS: The model showed adequate 
      accuracy and precision for C(0) and AUC prediction at ≤ 6 months (MPPE(C0): 
      8.1 ± 2.5%, MAPE(C0): 26.8 ± 2.1%; MPPE(AUC): - 9.7 ± 5.1%, MAPE(AUC): 
      13.3 ± 3.9%) and > 6 months post-transplant (MPPE(C0): 4.7 ± 2.0%, MAPE(C0): 
      25.4 ± 1.4%; MPPE(AUC): - 0.13 ± 4.8%, MAPE(AUC): 13.3 ± 2.8%). On average, dose 
      adaptation recommendations derived from C(0)-based and AUC-based model-informed 
      precision dosing were 2.91 ± 0.01% and 13.7 ± 0.18% lower than for conventional 
      C(0)-based therapeutic drug monitoring at ≤ 6 months, and 0.93 ± 0.01% and 
      3.14 ± 0.04% lower at > 6 months post-transplant. The ∆C(0) and ∆AUC 
      exceeded ± 20% on 13.6% and 14.3% of occasions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      demonstrated that our population pharmacokinetic model was able to accurately and 
      precisely predict future everolimus exposure from prior pharmacokinetic 
      measurements. In addition, we illustrated the potential added value of performing 
      everolimus therapeutic drug monitoring with haematocrit-normalised whole-blood 
      concentrations. Our results provide reassurance to implement this methodology in 
      clinical practice for further evaluation.

TI  - Age-dependent changes in sirolimus metabolite formation in patients with 
      neurofibromatosis type 1.
PG  - 395-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, which 
      exhibits large interindividual pharmacokinetic variability. We report sirolimus 
      pharmacokinetic data collected as part of a concentration-controlled multicenter 
      phase II clinical trial in pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. The 
      purpose of this study was to explore the effect of growth on age-dependent 
      changes in sirolimus clearance with a focus on cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) 
      subfamily mediated metabolism. METHODS: Predose blood samples were obtained at 
      steady state from 18 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. Sirolimus and its 5 
      CYP3A-dependent primary metabolites were quantified by HPLC-UV/MS. Concentration 
      ratios of metabolites to sirolimus (metabolic ratio) were calculated as an index 
      of metabolite formation. RESULTS: Metabolic ratios of the main metabolites, 
      16-O-demethylsirolimus (16-O-DM) and 24-hydroxysirolimus (24OH), were 
      significantly correlated with sirolimus clearance, whereas this was not the case 
      for the other 3 metabolites (25-hydroxysirolimus, 46-hydroxysirolimus, and 
      39-O-demethylsirolimus). The ratios for the 16-O-DM and 24OH metabolites were 
      lower in children than adults. No significant difference in allometrically scaled 
      metabolic ratios of 16-O-DM and 24OH was observed between children and adults. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the age-dependent changes in sirolimus 
      clearance can be explained by size-related increases in CYP3A metabolic capacity, 
      most likely due to liver and intestinal growth. These findings will help 
      facilitate the development of age-appropriate dosing algorithms for sirolimus in 
      infants and children.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to explore the population pharmacokinetics and 
      initial dose optimization of sirolimus improving drug blood level for seizure 
      control in pediatric patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Eighty 
      pediatric patients diagnosed with TSC-related epilepsy were included for 
      analysis. Sirolimus concentrations, physiological and biochemical indexes, and 
      drug combination were collected to build a nonlinear mixed effect (NONMEM) model. 
      Initial dose optimization was simulated by the Monte Carlo method. The weight and 
      concomitant medication of oxcarbazepine affected sirolimus clearance. Without 
      oxcarbazepine, for once-daily sirolimus regimen, the doses of 0.07, 0.06, 0.05, 
      0.04, and 0.03 mg/kg/day were recommended for weights of 5-7.5, 7.5-11.5, 
      11.5-19, 19-40, and 40-70 kg, respectively; for twice-daily sirolimus regimen, 
      the doses of 0.05, 0.04, and 0.03 were recommended for weights of 5-8, 8-20, and 
      20-70 kg, respectively. With oxcarbazepine, for once-daily sirolimus regimen, the 
      doses of 0.09, 0.08, 0.07, 0.06, 0.05, and 0.04 mg/kg/day were recommended for 
      weights of 5-7.5, 7.5-10, 10-13.5, 13.5-20, 20-35, and 35-70 kg, respectively; 
      for twice-daily sirolimus regimen, the doses of 0.06, 0.05, 0.04, and 0.03 were 
      recommended for weights of 5-7, 7-14.5, 14.5-38, and 38-70 kg, respectively. The 
      present study was the first to establish a population pharmacokinetic model of 
      sirolimus improving drug blood level for seizure control in pediatric patients 
      with TSC and recommend the initial dosage regimen.

TI  - Absorption and intestinal metabolism of SDZ-RAD and rapamycin in rats.
PG  - 627-32
AB  - The new immunosuppressive agent, SDZ-RAD, and its analog rapamycin were examined 
      for intestinal absorption, metabolism, and bioavailability in Wistar rats. 
      Intestinal first-pass metabolism studies from rat jejunum showed that at 0.5 mg 
      of SDZ-RAD/kg rat, 50% of the parent compound was metabolized in the intestinal 
      mucosa, and this decreased to around 30% when SDZ-RAD was increased to 5.0 mg/kg 
      rat. Results for rapamycin at the low dose were similar to those for SDZ-RAD, but 
      at the higher dose only 1 to 14% of the total rapamycin absorbed was metabolized 
      by the intestine. After i.v. administration of 1 mg/kg SDZ-RAD or rapamycin, the 
      area under the concentration curve (AUC) for rapamycin was twice that of SDZ-RAD, 
      resulting in a systemic clearance of 6.2 ml/min and 3.0 ml/min for SDZ-RAD and 
      rapamycin, respectively. However, the AUC for oral absorption was similar for the 
      two compounds: 140 and 172 ng*h/ml for SDZ-RAD and rapamycin, respectively. 
      Because blood clearance was faster for SDZ-RAD after i.v. administration, the 
      absolute oral bioavailability for SDZ-RAD was 16% compared with 10% for 
      rapamycin. Overall, the data suggest that intestinal first pass is a major site 
      of metabolism for SDZ-RAD and rapamycin and that intestinal absorption of SDZ-RAD 
      was much faster than that of rapamycin. This allowed it to counteract the 
      combined actions of faster systemic clearance and increased intestinal 
      metabolism, resulting in comparable absolute exposure when given orally. Also, 
      the coadministration of cyclosporin A with SDZ-RAD was shown to dramatically 
      increase blood AUCs for SDZ-RAD, probably through saturating intestinal 
      metabolism mechanisms.

TI  - Development of an ultra-performance liquid chromatography technique coupled with 
      mass spectrometry for the measurement of tacrolimus in micro-samples of whole 
      blood, and its application on a pharmacokiinetic trial.
PG  - 659-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to develop a rapid, specific, sensitive and accurate 
      chromatographic technique coupled with mass spectrometry for the measurement of 
      tacrolimus (CAS 104987-11-3) in microsamples of whole blood, and its application 
      on a pharmacokinetic pilot trial. METHODS: A fast gradient was designed in an 
      ultra-performance liquid chromatography, and coupled with a mass spectrometer for 
      the quantification of tacrolimus in 100 microl samples of EDTA whole blood. 
      Multiple reaction monitoring was used for the measurement of tacrolimus (m/z(+1) 
      821.49-->4768.35 Th) and sirolimus as internal standard (m/z(+1) 931.69-->864.39 
      Th). The method was validated according to Mexican regulatory guidelines. 
      Twenty-four young healthy male volunteers with similar hematocrit values 
      participated in the pharmacokinetic trial; an oral single dose of one 5 mg 
      tacrolimus capsule was administered and kinetic profiles were described since 0 h 
      until 24 h post-dose. RESULTS: Method showed to be accurate, precise and linear 
      over the range from 1 to 80 ng/ml, having an absolute recovery of 94%. Molecule 
      was stable for two months at -70 degrees C, and heparin interfered with its 
      quantification. Total run-time is around 1.5 min. Mean maximum blood 
      concentration was 32.63 +/- 1.74 ng/ml, and was reached at 1 h post-dose; 
      elimination half-life was 14.18 +/- 5.71 h. CONCLUSIONS: Method developed is not 
      time-consuming, inexpensive, and sensitive enough for its application during 
      pharmacokinetic trials, and can be suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring in 
      transplanted patients. Pharmacokinetic data obtained in Mexican population are 
      quite similar to previously reported in international literature.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of everolimus.
PG  - 83-95
AB  - Everolimus is an immunosuppressive macrolide bearing a stable 2-hydroxyethyl 
      chain substitution at position 40 on the sirolimus (rapamycin) structure. 
      Everolimus, which has greater polarity than sirolimus, was developed in an 
      attempt to improve the pharmacokinetic characteristics of sirolimus, particularly 
      to increase its oral bioavailability. Everolimus has a mechanism of action 
      similar to that of sirolimus. It blocks growth-driven transduction signals in the 
      T-cell response to alloantigen and thus acts at a later stage than the 
      calcineurin inhibitors ciclosporin and tacrolimus. Everolimus and ciclosporin 
      show synergism in immunosuppression both in vitro and in vivo and therefore the 
      drugs are intended to be given in combination after solid organ transplantation. 
      The synergistic effect allows a dosage reduction that decreases adverse effects. 
      For the quantification of the pharmacokinetics of everolimus, nine different 
      assays using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an electrospray 
      mass spectrometer, and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, have been 
      developed. Oral everolimus is absorbed rapidly, and reaches peak concentration 
      after 1.3-1.8 hours. Steady state is reached within 7 days, and steady-state peak 
      and trough concentrations, and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), are 
      proportional to dosage. In adults, everolimus pharmacokinetic characteristics do 
      not differ according to age, weight or sex, but bodyweight-adjusted dosages are 
      necessary in children. The interindividual pharmacokinetic variability of 
      everolimus can be explained by different activities of the drug efflux pump 
      P-glycoprotein and of metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, 3A5 and 2C8. The 
      critical role of the CYP3A4 system for everolimus biotransformation leads to 
      drug-drug interactions with other drugs metabolised by this cytochrome system. In 
      patients with hepatic impairment, the apparent clearance of everolimus is 
      significantly lower than in healthy volunteers, and therefore the dosage of 
      everolimus should be reduced by half in these patients. The advantage of 
      everolimus seems to be its lower nephrotoxicity in comparison with the standard 
      immunosuppressants ciclosporin and tacrolimus. Observed adverse effects with 
      everolimus include hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, opportunistic 
      infections, thrombocytopenia and leucocytopenia. Because of the variable oral 
      bioavailability and narrow therapeutic index of everolimus, blood concentration 
      monitoring seems to be important. The excellent correlation between steady-state 
      trough concentration and AUC makes the former a simple and reliable index for 
      monitoring everolimus exposure. The target trough concentration of everolimus 
      should range between 3 and 15 microg/L in combination therapy with ciclosporin 
      (trough concentration 100-300 microg/L) and prednisone.

TI  - Long-term outcome of very early cyclosporine minimization and de novo everolimus 
      therapy in kidney transplant recipients: a pharmacokinetic guided approach.
PG  - 4040-2
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2010.09.054 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine (CsA) nephrotoxicity is an important cause of chronic 
      allograft dysfunction. Clinical information concerning the impact of very early 
      CsA dose reduction in kidney transplant recipients is limited. We have examined 
      the long-term outcomes of very early CsA dose reduction. This is synchronized 
      with de novo everolimus and steroid therapy. METHODS: We enrolled 10 de novo 
      kidney transplant recipients to receive CsA (target C(0) 250-350 ng/mL) and 
      prednisolone as initial therapy. CsA dosage was reduced by 50% at posttransplant 
      day 7. Everolimus (target trough level, 3-8 ng/mL) was concomitantly started at 
      the day of CsA reduction. Full pharmacokinetic studies of everolimus and CsA were 
      studied at the period of 4-8 weeks after CsA reduction. CsA was then gradually 
      reduced to maintain a trough level of 50-100 ng/mL and/or C(max) <600 ng/mL. 
      RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 51.2 ± 3.45 months. The nadir serum creatinine 
      was 1.03 ± 0.33 mg/dL. The mean initial estimated glomerular filtration rate 
      (eGFR) was 97.97 ± 23.36 mL/min. The mean initial trough everolimus was 5.2 ± 1.5 
      ng/mL. The eGFR at 1 year, 3 years, and last follow-up was 82 ± 25, 80 ± 21, and 
      80 ± 25 mL/min, respectively. Patient and graft survival was 100%. CONCLUSION: 
      Very early CsA dose reduction synchronized with de novo everolimus therapy was 
      associated with good long-term patient and graft survival in kidney transplant 
      recipients. This intervention can lead to 75% CsA minimization and is associated 
      with very good GFR by the modification of Diet in Renal Disease Formula at year 
      4.

TI  - Influence of genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A5 and ABCB1 on sirolimus 
      pharmacokinetics, patient and graft survival and other clinical outcomes in renal 
      transplant.
PG  - 49-58
LID - 10.1515/dmpt-2016-0040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In transplant patients receiving de novo anticalcineurin-free 
      sirolimus (SRL)-based immunosuppression, we determined the influence of 
      cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) and ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP), 
      member (ABCB1) genotypes on SRL blood levels and medium-term relevant clinical 
      outcomes, in order to improve effectiveness of immunosuppression strategies when 
      anti-mammalian target of rapamycin (anti-mTOR) inhibitor is indicated for 
      clinical reasons. METHODS: Forty-eight renal transplant recipients (suffered 48% 
      diabetes mellitus, 91% hypertension, and 47% dyslipidemia) were genotyped for 
      CYP3A5 (6986A>G) and ABCB1 (3435C>T) polymorphisms by polymerase chain 
      reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Sirolimus blood levels were 
      determined using microparticle enzyme immunoassay technique. Relationships 
      between genotypes and pharmacokinetics, graft function, and patient-graft 
      survival were determined by univariate analysis. RESULTS: CYP3A5*1/*3 showed 
      lower SRL levels than CYP3A5*3/*3 (4.13±1.54 vs. 8.49±4.18 ng/mL; p=0.003) and 
      level/dose ratio (LDR) (92.74±37.47 vs. 178.62±116.45; p=0.019) in early 
      post-transplant period. In ABCB1 polymorphisms, CT genotypes showed higher SRL 
      levels than CC and TT (8.93±2.22 vs. 7.28±2.47 vs. 7.35±1.15 ng/mL; p=0.038) in 
      the late period; LDR in CC and CT were 171.29±36.24 vs. 335.66±138.71 (p=0.003), 
      despite receiving lower doses (p=0.018). Acute rejection rate was 14% vs. 42% for 
      *3/*3 and 14% (TT), 48% (CT), and 31% (CC). Median patient survival was 45 
      months, significantly lower than that of *3/*3 patients (69 months). 
      Death-censored graft survival during 5-year follow-up was similar for both CYP3A5 
      genotypes and significantly lower in TT than CT and CC groups, without survival 
      differences. CONCLUSIONS: CYP3A5 and ABCB1 polymorphisms influenced SRL levels; 
      preliminary data suggest this may affect patient and graft survival. Genotyping 
      renal transplant patients could help select candidates for SRL (genotype*3/*3 for 
      CYP3A5 and CT for ABCB1), when anti-mTOR immunosuppression is indicated.

TI  - Randomized phase II study of multiple dose levels of CCI-779, a novel mammalian 
      target of rapamycin kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced refractory renal 
      cell carcinoma.
PG  - 909-18
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses 
      of CCI-779, a novel mammalian target of rapamycin kinase inhibitor, in patients 
      with advanced refractory renal cell carcinoma (RCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Patients (n = 111) were randomly assigned to receive 25, 75, or 250 mg CCI-779 
      weekly as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. Patients were evaluated for tumor 
      response, time to tumor progression, survival, and adverse events. Blood samples 
      were collected to determine CCI-779 pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: CCI-779 produced 
      an objective response rate of 7% (one complete response and seven partial 
      responses) and minor responses in 26% of these advanced RCC patients. Median time 
      to tumor progression was 5.8 months and median survival was 15.0 months. The most 
      frequently occurring CCI-779-related adverse events of all grades were 
      maculopapular rash (76%), mucositis (70%), asthenia (50%), and nausea (43%). The 
      most frequently occurring grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hyperglycemia (17%), 
      hypophosphatemia (13%), anemia (9%), and hypertriglyceridemia (6%). Neither 
      toxicity nor efficacy was significantly influenced by CCI-779 dose level. 
      Patients were retrospectively classified into good-, intermediate-, or poor-risk 
      groups on the basis of criteria used by Motzer et al for a first-line metastatic 
      RCC population treated with interferon alfa. Within each risk group, the median 
      survivals of patients at each dose level were similar. CONCLUSION: In patients 
      with advanced RCC, CCI-779 showed antitumor activity and encouraging survival and 
      was generally well tolerated over the three dose levels tested.

TI  - Apparent clearance of sirolimus in heart transplant recipients: impact of primary 
      diagnosis and serum lipids.
PG  - 614-22
AB  - The study was aimed to identify factors affecting sirolimus apparent clearance 
      (CL/F) in de novo heart transplant recipients using a population pharmacokinetic 
      approach. A total of 31 patients (7 female and 24 male) originally included in a 
      formal clinical trial, contributed 524 sirolimus blood concentrations with the 
      time after dose ranging from 11.08 to 31.83 hours. Sirolimus concentrations were 
      measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and data analysis 
      was carried out using NONMEM (Globomax LLC, Hanover, MD) software. Factors 
      screened included age, weight, gender, primary diagnosis, biochemical and 
      hematological indices, cyclosporine dose, days post-transplant and potential 
      interacting medications. The predictive performance of the final model was 
      evaluated using a data-splitting method. Sirolimus apparent clearance (CL/F) was 
      decreased by 20.8% for every 100-mg increase in cyclosporine daily dose and was 
      62.1% lower in patients with primary diagnosis of ischemic heart disease (IHD). 
      Sirolimus apparent clearance was 37.8% lower when triglyceride was greater than 2 
      mmol/L. Based on the final model, the average values for sirolimus CL/F and 
      apparent volume of distribution were 7.09 and 1,350 L/h, respectively. 
      Inter-subject variability in CL/F was 27.5% and residual random error was 24.1%. 
      This study identified cyclosporine dose, hypertriglyceridemia and primary 
      diagnosis of IHD as the most important factors affecting sirolimus CL/F. This 
      information may assist in dose individualization of sirolimus in transplant 
      recipients.

TI  - A phase I trial to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose 
      of deforolimus in patients with advanced malignancies.
PG  - 1428-34
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-2076 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This was a phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose and 
      toxicity of deforolimus (AP23573, MK-8669), an inhibitor of mammalian target of 
      rapamycin (mTOR). The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antineoplastic 
      effects were also studied. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Deforolimus was administered 
      intravenously over 30 min every 7 days according to a flat dosing schedule. Dose 
      was escalated according to an accelerated titration design. Patients remained on 
      study until disease progression as long as they tolerated the drug without 
      significant toxicities. RESULTS: Forty-six patients were enrolled on the study. 
      Common side effects included fatigue, anorexia, and mucositis. The maximum 
      tolerated dose was 75 mg and mucositis was the dose-limiting toxicity. Similar to 
      other mTOR inhibitors, deforolimus exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics and a 
      prolonged half-life. Among 34 patients evaluable for response, 1 patient had a 
      partial response, 21 patients had stable disease, and 12 had progressed. Percent 
      change in tumor size was significantly associated with AUC (P=0.015). A 
      significant association was also detected for maximum change in cholesterol 
      within the first two cycles of therapy and change in tumor size (r=-0.38; 
      P=0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Deforolimus was well tolerated on the schedule tested in 
      this trial with toxicity and pharmacokinetic profiles that were similar to that 
      of other mTOR inhibitors. Additional phase II studies are needed to determine if 
      deforolimus is superior to other mTOR inhibitors in terms of efficacy. The change 
      in serum cholesterol as a potential biomarker of activity should be studied 
      further.

TI  - Sirolimus for rescue and primary immunosuppression in transplanted children 
      receiving tacrolimus.
PG  - 851-5
AB  - AIMS: The role of sirolimus (SRL) as a rescue agent (n=42) and as a component of 
      primary immunosuppression (n=8) was evaluated in a mixed population of 50 
      transplanted children receiving tacrolimus (liver: 26, heart: 5, intestinal: 5, 
      liver-intestine: 9, lung: 1, bone marrow: 1, liver-kidney: 1, multivisceral: 1). 
      Rescue indications for tacrolimus (TAC) failure were recurrent acute rejection 
      and acute rejection complicating withdrawal of immunosuppression in 
      posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Rescue indications for TAC 
      toxicity were nephrotoxicity, pancreatitis, seizures, hypertrophic 
      cardiomyopathy, and graft-versus-host disease. RESULTS: Mean age at rescue was 
      11.5 years and mean follow-up was 204 (range 18-800) days. As primary 
      immunosuppression, SRL+TAC prevented early acute rejection in 7/8 children. The 
      indication for rescue resolved in 33/42 children. In children with TAC toxicity, 
      this was associated with decrease in TAC doses by 50%, significant improvements 
      in renal function, and continuing decline in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral load 
      in PTLD patients. Serious adverse events led to discontinuation of SRL in 9/42 
      rescue patients, 3 of them also experienced acute rejection. Three additional 
      children also experienced acute rejection on SRL therapy (overall incidence 6/50, 
      12%). Pharmacokinetic analysis in the first week of SRL administration suggested 
      a short half-life (11.8+/-5.5 hr, n=21). CONCLUSIONS: SRL and reduced-dose TAC 
      may achieve adequate immunosuppression without compromising renal function or 
      enhancing EBV viremia significantly.

TI  - Differential effects of ketoconazole on exposure to temsirolimus following 
      intravenous infusion of temsirolimus.
PG  - 1797-802
LID - 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604376 [doi]
AB  - Intravenous (i.v.) temsirolimus, a novel inhibitor of mammalian target of 
      rapamycin, is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and is 
      being studied in patients with mantle cell lymphoma. Because temsirolimus and its 
      primary metabolite, sirolimus, are metabolised by the cytochrome P450 3A4 pathway 
      (CYP3A4), the potential exists for pharmacokinetic (PK) drug interactions with 
      the numerous agents that modulate CYP3A4 isozyme activity. We investigated the 
      effects of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the PK profile of i.v. 
      temsirolimus in healthy adults. Coadministration of 400 mg oral ketoconazole with 
      5 mg i.v. temsirolimus had no significant effect on temsirolimus maximum 
      concentration (C(max)) or area under the concentration curve (AUC). However, mean 
      AUC increased 3.1-fold and AUC(sum) (sum of temsirolimus plus sirolimus AUCs) 
      increased 2.3-fold compared with temsirolimus alone. A single 5-mg dose of 
      temsirolimus with ketoconazole was well tolerated, and there were no unexpected 
      safety results. Therefore, in cancer patients receiving 25 mg i.v. temsirolimus, 
      concomitant treatment with agents that have strong CYP3A4 inhibition potential 
      should be avoided. If a concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary, a 
      temsirolimus dose reduction to 12.5 mg weekly should be considered.

TI  - A pharmacological rationale for improved everolimus dosing in oncology and 
      transplant patients.
PG  - 1575-1586
LID - 10.1111/bcp.13591 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Everolimus is a drug from the class of mammalian target of rapamycin 
      inhibitors used for both immunosuppressant and oncological indications. We 
      postulate that there is room for improvement of dosing, as the optimal 
      immunosuppressive dose in calcineurin-free regimens is unknown and since the once 
      daily dosing regimen for oncological indications is often associated with 
      treatment-limiting toxicity. METHODS: We developed a mechanistic population 
      pharmacokinetic model for everolimus in cancer and transplant patients and 
      explored alternative dosing regimens. RESULTS: We found that formulation did not 
      influence bioavailability and that use of >20 mg prednisolone daily increased 
      everolimus clearance. In transplant patients, the approved dose of 0.75-1 mg 
      twice daily (BID) results in subtherapeutic trough levels (<6 μg l(-1) ) and that 
      a higher starting dose of 2.25-3 mg BID is required. CONCLUSION: For oncological 
      indications, our results encourage the investigation of dosing everolimus 3.75 mg 
      BID in terms of superiority in safety and noninferiority in efficacy.

PG  - 6587

AB  - Curcumin, a specific secondary metabolite of Curcuma species, has potentials for 
      a variety of beneficial health effects. It is nowadays used as a dietary 
      supplement. Everolimus (EVL) is an immunosuppressant indicated for allograft 
      rejection and cancer therapy, but with narrow therapeutic window. EVL is a 
      substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). This study 
      investigated the effect of coadministration of curcumin on the pharmacokinetics 
      of EVL in rats and the underlying mechanisms. EVL (0.5 mg/kg) was orally 
      administered without and with 50 and 100 mg/kg of curcumin, respectively, in 
      rats. Blood samples were collected at specific time points and EVL concentrations 
      in blood were determined by QMS immunoassay. The underlying mechanisms were 
      evaluated using cell model and recombinant CYP 3A4 isozyme. The results indicated 
      that 50 and 100 mg/kg of curcumin significantly decreased the AUC0-540 of EVL by 
      70.6% and 71.5%, respectively, and both dosages reduced the Cmax of EVL by 76.7%. 
      Mechanism studies revealed that CYP3A4 was markedly activated by curcumin 
      metabolites, which apparently overrode the inhibition effects of curcumin on 
      P-gp. In conclusion, oral intake of curcumin significantly decreased the 
      bioavailability of EVL, a probe substrate of P-gp/CYP 3A4, mainly through marked 
      activation on CYP 3A4.

TI  - Association of Genetic Variants in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19 with 
      Tacrolimus Pharmacokinetics in Renal Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 609-618
LID - 10.2174/1389200220666190627101927 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our study aimed to investigate the pharmacogenetics of cytochrome 
      P3A4 (CYP3A4), CYP3A5, CYP2C8, and CYP2C19 and their influence on TAC 
      Pharmacokinetics (PKs) in short-term renal transplant recipients. METHODS: A 
      total of 105 renal transplant recipients were enrolled. Target Sequencing (TS) 
      based on next-generation sequencing technology was used to detect all exons, 
      exon/intron boundaries, and flanking regions of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, and 
      CYP2C19. After adjustment of Minor Allele Frequencies (MAF) and Hardy-Weinberg 
      Equilibrium (HWE) analysis, tagger Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and 
      haplotypes were identified. Influence of tagger SNPs on TAC concentrations was 
      analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 94 SNPs were identified in TS analysis. Nine tagger 
      SNPs were selected, and two SNPs (rs15524 and rs4646453) were noted to be 
      significantly associated with TAC PKs in short-term post-transplant follow-up. 
      Measurement time points of TAC, body mass index (BMI), usage of sirolimus, and 
      incidence of Delayed Graft Function (DGF) were observed to be significantly 
      associated with TAC PKs. Three haplotypes were identified, and rs15524-rs4646453 
      was found to remarkably contribute to TAC PKs. Recipients carrying H2/H2 (GG-AA) 
      haplotype also showed significantly high weight- and dose-adjusted TAC 
      concentrations in posttransplant periods of 7, 14, and 30 days and 3 and 6 
      months. CONCLUSIONS: Two tagger SNPs, namely, rs15524 and rs4646453, are 
      significantly related to the variability of TAC disposition, and TAC measurement 
      time points, BMI, usage of sirolimus, and incidence of DGF contribute to this 
      influence. Recipients carrying H2/H2 (GG-AA) haplotype in rs15524-rs4646453 may 
      require a low dosage of TAC during 1-year follow-up posttransplant.

TI  - Rapamycin: distribution, pharmacokinetics and therapeutic range investigations: 
      an update.
PG  - 345-51
AB  - Based on the findings above, a number of conclusions can be made regarding the 
      distribution, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic range investigations with RAPA: 
      (a) the majority of the drug is sequestered in erythrocytes, resulting in whole 
      blood concentrations being considerably higher than plasma concentrations; (b) 
      the drug is metabolized by the same cytochrome P450 3A enzyme involved in the 
      metabolism of CsA and FK506. Metabolites are primarily simple demethylations and 
      hydroxylations with 41-O-demethyl RAPA being the major metabolite both in vivo 
      and in vitro; (c) the drug has a relatively long half-life in both humans and 
      animals with 24-h trough concentrations being within the analytical range of HPLC 
      when immunosuppressive doses are administered; (d) the drug exhibits a degree of 
      proportionality between trough concentrations and dose; (e) a strong correlation 
      exists between area under the concentration-time curve and trough blood 
      concentration at steady state; (f) trough concentrations of the drug appear to be 
      related to immunosuppressive efficacy and drug-related side effects; (g) the 
      nephro- and neurotoxic properties of CsA are not augmented by concurrent 
      treatment with RAPA; and (h) phase IIB trial results have shown a decrease of 
      acute rejection episodes from 40% to < 10% among patients treated with full-dose 
      CsA plus RAPA. The studies described here should provide a basis for the 
      establishment of therapeutic monitoring protocols for RAPA. In addition, new 
      derivatives of RAPA, such as SDZ RAD, designed to overcome formulation problems 
      associated with RAPA, while maintaining similar pharmacokinetics and in vivo 
      activity, show promise as alternatives to RAPA.

TI  - Correlation of toxicity and efficacy with pharmacokinetics (PK) of pegylated 
      liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) (Caelyx®).
PG  - 457-63

AB  - PURPOSE: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is used to treat patients with 
      breast and gynecological cancers. In order to optimize treatment with PLD, we 
      assessed the prognostic and predictive factors for efficacy of PLD. METHODS: 
      Seventeen patients treated with PLD 30 or 40 mg/m(2) underwent pharmacokinetic 
      sampling during the first cycle of treatment. PLD exposure was calculated. An 
      univariate analysis was performed with the variables: hand-foot syndrome, 
      mucositis, rash, neutropenia, age, tumor type, number of previous therapies, ECOG 
      performance status and progression-free survival (PFS). Candidate variables with 
      p ≤ 0.1 were selected for the multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Based on the 
      results of the multivariate analysis, the PLD exposure (log AUC) was higher in 
      patients who experienced rash (p = 0.002) and mucositis (p = 0.001) compared to 
      those who did not have these adverse events. The development of hand-foot 
      syndrome was significantly related to a lower risk of disease progression (HR 
      0.1; 95 % CI 0.02-0.64). Patients with an ECOG status of 0 had a longer PFS than 
      the patients with an ECOG status of 1 (HR 5.4; 95 % CI 1.3-22.8). Moreover, PLD 
      exposure (ln AUC) was also positively related to PFS (HR 0.001; 95 % CI 
      0.00-0.42). CONCLUSIONS: The extent of the exposure to PLD was correlated with 
      more adverse events and longer PFS. This has important clinical implications, 
      since dose reductions or interruptions might thus negatively affect treatment 
      outcomes. More attention should be paid to preventive and supportive measures of 
      adverse events of PLD to keep the exposure to PLD as high as possible.

TI  - Synergistic effects of sirolimus with cyclosporine and tacrolimus: analysis of 
      immunosuppression on lymphocyte proliferation and activation in rat whole blood.
PG  - 1154-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Whole-blood analysis of lymphocyte function was used to investigate 
      the pharmacodynamic (PD) interaction of sirolimus (SRL) with cyclosporine (CsA) 
      or tacrolimus (TRL) in vitro and to determine the relation between PD and 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of SRL in an in vivo rat model. METHODS: In vitro, 
      experiments involved incubation of increasing concentrations (0.25-25 [corrected] 
      nM) of SRL with either CsA or TRL in rat whole blood. For the in vivo study, rats 
      were orally treated with different doses of SRL alone (1, 3, 5, or 8 mg/kg) or 
      with a combination of 3 mg/kg SRL plus 2.5 or 5 mg/kg CsA. Blood was obtained 
      before and at different times after dosing. Inhibition of lymphocyte 
      proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA]) and activation (CD25, 
      CD71, CD11a, CD134) in mitogen-stimulated blood was determined using 
      fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. SRL and CsA blood concentrations 
      were determined at the same time points by light chromatography tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS). RESULTS: In vitro, concentrations of SRL between 0.25-25 
      [corrected] nM acted synergistically in combination with CsA or TRL at 
      concentrations between 0.25-1.0 [corrected] nM. Higher SRL concentrations did not 
      further increase inhibition of lymphocyte function in these combinations. In 
      vivo, good correlations (r=0.68-0.94) were observed between PD parameters of 
      lymphocyte function and SRL-PK and dose. Increasing SRL doses produced higher 
      blood concentrations, but SRL doses of 8 mg/kg did not further increase 
      inhibition of lymphocyte function. PD effects on lymphocyte function were 
      prolonged, but maximal inhibition was not increased when SRL was applied in 
      combination with CsA as compared to SRL mono therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      suggest that analysis of lymphocyte function in whole blood may be useful to 
      optimize dosing of SRL in combination with CsA or TRL and that PD monitoring of 
      immunosuppressive drugs will enhance the value of PK monitoring.

TI  - Ridaforolimus for patients with progressive or recurrent malignant glioma: a 
      perisurgical, sequential, ascending-dose trial.
PG  - 849-60
LID - 10.1007/s00280-011-1773-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This perisurgical phase 1 study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, 
      pharmacodynamics, and safety of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
      inhibitor ridaforolimus in patients (N = 10) with progressive or recurrent 
      primary grade IV malignant glioma, who failed standard therapy. The primary 
      objective of the study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
      ridaforolimus. METHODS: Treatment was administered intravenously at doses of 12.5 
      mg (N = 7) or 15 mg (N = 3) once daily for 4 days prior to surgical resection, 
      then resumed for 5 consecutive days every 2 weeks until disease progression or 
      unacceptable toxicity, following a postsurgical recovery period. RESULTS: The MTD 
      was not determined because the trial was suspended early due to slower than 
      expected patient accrual and postsurgical drug administration challenges. 
      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses showed that ridaforolimus 
      concentrations declined slowly during the 24-h dosing interval and remained 
      detectable for 10 days after the last infusion in whole blood samples. In 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells, median levels of the mTOR downstream effector 
      p4E-BP1 were reduced by >80% compared with baseline by 4 h after dosing. Resected 
      brain specimens showed reduced levels of pS6, another mTOR downstream effector, 
      while nuclear staining for p27(kip1), a protein that functions as a cell cycle 
      inhibitor, increased after treatment. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed, 
      and the reported adverse events were consistent with the previously established 
      safety profile for ridaforolimus. One of 3 patients evaluable for efficacy had 
      stable disease as best response. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that ridaforolimus 
      can cross the blood-brain barrier in areas of tumor involvement, and may inhibit 
      mTOR activity in advanced gliomas based on decreased pS6 levels. This 
      perisurgical trial design should serve as a template for evaluating intratumoral 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of other targeted agents in this patient 
      population.

TI  - Coadministration of neoral and the novel rapamycin analog, SDZ RAD, to rat lung 
      allograft recipients: potentiation of immunosuppressive efficacy and improvement 
      of tolerability of staggered versus simultaneous treatment.
PG  - 956-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neoral and rapamycin derivative (RAD) have complementary mechanisms 
      for inhibition of lymphocyte activation and are substrates for the same pathways 
      of drug metabolism. Therefore, we investigated treatment regimens designed to 
      minimize pharmacokinetic interactions and to potentiate immunosuppressive 
      efficacy in a highly stringent rat lung allograft model. METHODS: Lewis 
      recipients of Brown Norway lungs received the following daily oral doses: (A) RAD 
      at 2.5 mg/kg (n=9); (B) Neoral at 7.5 mg/kg (n=8); (C) RAD at 2.5 mg/kg + Neoral 
      at 7.5 mg/kg simultaneously (n=8); or (D) RAD at 2.5 mg/kg + Neoral at 7.5 mg/kg 
      (n=6) staggered 6 hr apart. Rats were assessed by daily weights, chest 
      radiographs, drug trough levels (high-performance liquid chromatography/mass 
      spectrometry), and blinded scoring of graft histology at death (day 21). RESULTS: 
      Radiographs were completely opacified in all grafts of control and RAD 
      monotherapy groups on days 7 and 14, respectively. Grafts were mildly opacified 
      (Neoral monotherapy) and completely clear (both RAD + Neoral groups) on day 21. 
      Simultaneous or staggered combined treatment dramatically reduced histologic 
      rejection compared with treatment with either drug alone. Simultaneous treatment 
      caused poor tolerability (poor grooming, lethargy) and significantly higher 
      day-14 RAD and cyclosporine (CsA) trough levels (49+/-5 and 638+/-106 ng/ml; 
      P<0.04) than in the staggered group (28+/-3 and 318+/-25 ng/ml) in which all 
      animals were clinically normal. RAD and CsA day-14 trough levels in the staggered 
      group were the same or lower than trough levels in animals treated with either 
      drug alone (RAD 27+/-3/Neoral 815+/-67 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: (1) Administration of 
      RAD + Neoral suppressed lung rejection more effectively than treatment with 
      either drug alone. (2) Trough levels did not differ between monotherapy and 
      staggered combination therapy for RAD but were lower for CsA. These results 
      suggested that pharmacological, rather than pharmacokinetic, interactions between 
      the parent drugs were responsible for the potentiation of immunosuppression when 
      these drugs were coadministered. 3) Staggered administration of RAD+Neoral 
      avoided the pharmacokinetic interactions that caused the elevated drug blood 
      levels and poor tolerability caused by simultaneous administration. Thus, we 
      could potentiate efficacy and improve tolerability by staggering administration 
      of RAD and Neoral.

TI  - Relative tissue distributions of cyclosporine and sirolimus after concomitant 
      peroral administration to the rat: evidence for pharmacokinetic interactions.
PG  - 123-33
AB  - The authors sought to determine the effect of concomitant peroral (PO) 
      administration of cyclosporine (CsA) and sirolimus (SRL, rapamycin) on the tissue 
      distributions of CsA and SRL in the rat. Groups of four adult male Wistar-Furth 
      rats were treated for 14 days with 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 mg CsA/kg x day. Other 
      groups of four adult male Wistar-Furth rats were treated for 14 days with a 
      1-to-6.25 weight-to-weight ratio of SRL to CsA at SRL doses of 0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 
      mg/kg x day. Concentrations of CsA and SRL in homogenates of heart, intestinal, 
      kidney, liver, lung, muscle, spleen, and testes were compared to those in whole 
      blood (WB). There was a large, dose-dependent, distinctive distribution of CsA 
      among rat tissues, as has previously been well documented. At a constant molar 
      dose ratio, concomitant oral administration of SRL produced an approximately 
      two-fold increase in the concentrations of CsA in rat tissues, although SRL did 
      not change the CsA tissue-to-WB partition coefficients. Concomitant oral CsA 
      administration produced dose-dependent increases in SRL tissue concentrations and 
      decreases in the SRL tissue-to-WB partition coefficients. The increases in tissue 
      and WB concentrations on coadministration of both agents may be explained either 
      by an increase in absorption caused by competition between the two agents for 
      binding sites on P-glycoprotein in the gut, a reduced rate of metabolism, or to 
      an as yet unidentified elimination mechanism. The dose-independent and unchanged 
      CsA tissue-to-WB partition coefficients suggest that SRL does not affect the 
      equilibrium of CsA between the central and tissue compartments, namely the tissue 
      uptake or intracellular binding. Altered values of the SRL tissue-to-WB partition 
      coefficients suggest that, under the conditions studied, CsA disturbs the 
      equilibrium of SRL between the central and tissue compartments.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of oral everolimus in patients with 
      seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex.
PG  - 707-719
LID - 10.1007/s10928-018-9600-2 [doi]
AB  - Everolimus is approved in Europe and in the USA for the adjunctive treatment of 
      patients aged 2 years and older whose refractory partial-onset seizures, with or 
      without secondary generalization, are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. 
      The objective of this analysis was to establish a population pharmacokinetic 
      (PK)/pharmacodynamic model describing the relationship between seizure frequency 
      and everolimus exposure to confirm the recommended target concentration range of 
      5-15 ng/mL. The PK model was a two-compartment model with first order absorption 
      and clearance. CYP3A and P-gp inducers and body-surface area were shown to impact 
      everolimus exposure, justifying dose adjustments. A Poisson distribution was 
      found to adequately describe the random nature of daily seizure counts during the 
      screening phase. A placebo effect on the Poisson seizure mean was implemented as 
      an asymptotic exponential function of time leading to a new steady-state seizure 
      mean. The everolimus effect was implemented as an inhibitory E(max) function of 
      C(min) on the seizure mean, where E(max) exhibited an asymptotic exponential 
      increase over time to a higher steady-state value. Increasing age was found to 
      decrease the baseline seizure mean and to prolong the half-life of the increase 
      in E(max). The dependence of seizure frequencies on C(min) was explored by 
      simulation. The responder rate increased with increasing C(min). As C(min) 
      decreased below 5 ng/mL, variability in response became larger and responder 
      rates decreased more rapidly. The results supported the recommended target 
      concentration range for everolimus of 5-15 ng/mL to ensure treatment efficacy.

TI  - Combined MTOR and autophagy inhibition: phase I trial of hydroxychloroquine and 
      temsirolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors and melanoma.
PG  - 1391-402
LID - 10.4161/auto.29119 [doi]
AB  - The combination of temsirolimus (TEM), an MTOR inhibitor, and hydroxychloroquine 
      (HCQ), an autophagy inhibitor, augments cell death in preclinical models. This 
      phase 1 dose-escalation study evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, 
      preliminary activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of HCQ in 
      combination with TEM in cancer patients. In the dose escalation portion, 27 
      patients with advanced solid malignancies were enrolled, followed by a cohort 
      expansion at the top dose level in 12 patients with metastatic melanoma. The 
      combination of HCQ and TEM was well tolerated, and grade 3 or 4 toxicity was 
      limited to anorexia (7%), fatigue (7%), and nausea (7%). An MTD was not reached 
      for HCQ, and the recommended phase II dose was HCQ 600 mg twice daily in 
      combination with TEM 25 mg weekly. Other common grade 1 or 2 toxicities included 
      fatigue, anorexia, nausea, stomatitis, rash, and weight loss. No responses were 
      observed; however, 14/21 (67%) patients in the dose escalation and 14/19 (74%) 
      patients with melanoma achieved stable disease. The median progression-free 
      survival in 13 melanoma patients treated with HCQ 1200mg/d in combination with 
      TEM was 3.5 mo. Novel 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
      (FDG-PET) measurements predicted clinical outcome and provided further evidence 
      that the addition of HCQ to TEM produced metabolic stress on tumors in patients 
      that experienced clinical benefit. Pharmacodynamic evidence of autophagy 
      inhibition was evident in serial PBMC and tumor biopsies only in patients treated 
      with 1200 mg daily HCQ. This study indicates that TEM and HCQ is safe and 
      tolerable, modulates autophagy in patients, and has significant antitumor 
      activity. Further studies combining MTOR and autophagy inhibitors in cancer 
      patients are warranted.

TI  - Randomised clinical trial: comparison of two everolimus dosing schedules in 
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 62-73
LID - 10.1111/apt.12132 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling is 
      common in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). AIM: To determine the maximum 
      tolerated dose (MTD) of the oral mTOR inhibitor everolimus in advanced HCC 
      patients. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic HCC (Child-Pugh 
      class A or B) were enrolled in an open-label phase 1 study and randomly assigned 
      to daily (2.5-10 mg) or weekly (20-70 mg) everolimus in a standard 3 + 3 
      dose-escalation design. MTD was based on the rate of dose-limiting toxicities 
      (DLTs). Secondary endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics and tumour 
      response. In a post hoc analysis, serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels were 
      quantified. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were enrolled. DLTs occurred in five of 
      21 patients in the daily and two of 19 patients in the weekly cohort. Daily and 
      weekly MTDs were 7.5 mg and 70 mg respectively. Grade 3/4 adverse events with a 
      ≥10% incidence were thrombocytopenia, hypophosphataemia and alanine transaminase 
      (ALT) elevation. In four hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-seropositive 
      patients, grade 3/4 ALT elevations were accompanied by significant (>1 log) 
      increases in serum HBV levels. The incidence of hepatitis flare (defined as ALT 
      increase >100 IU/mL from baseline) in HBsAg-seropositive patients with and 
      without detectable serum HBV DNA before treatment was 46.2% and 7.1% respectively 
      (P < 0.01, Fisher exact test). Disease control rates in the daily and weekly 
      cohorts were 71.4% and 44.4% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended 
      everolimus dosing schedule for future hepatocellular carcinoma studies is 7.5 mg 
      daily. Prophylactic anti-viral therapy should be mandatory for HBsAg-seropositive 
      patients (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00390195).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct a phase II trial of the combination of carboplatin, 
      prednisone, and everolimus in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer 
      (mCRPC) as mTOR inhibition can overcome resistance to chemotherapy in prostate 
      cancer. METHODS: Patients with progressive mCRPC pretreated with docetaxel-based 
      regimen were eligible. Performance status of 0-1 and adequate bone marrow, renal, 
      and liver function were required. Primary end point was time to progression. 
      Treatment consisted of carboplatin (starting dose equal to area under the curve 
      (AUC of 5) intravenously every 21 days along with oral everolimus 5 mg once daily 
      and prednisone 5 mg twice daily. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were enrolled with 
      median age of 69 years with 8 patients of African American origin. Grade 3 or 4 
      thrombocytopenia or neutropenia in 4 of 6 initial patients required dose 
      adjustment of carboplatin to AUC of 4 for subsequent patients. There were no 
      pharmacokinetic interactions between carboplatin and everolimus. The median time 
      to progression was 2.5 months (90% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-4.3 months), and 
      median overall survival was 12.5 months (90% CI, 7.7-18.7 months). Of 10 
      patients, 8 that demonstrated positive nuclear phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) staining 
      on immunohistochemistry progressed within 9 weeks, whereas 2 patients with 
      negative staining continued without progression for prolonged durations of 30 and 
      48 weeks. TSC1 gene mutations did not correlate with clinical outcome. 
      CONCLUSION: The addition of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to carboplatin 
      demonstrated minimal clinical efficacy in metastatic prostate cancer. pAKT 
      testing warrants further evaluation as a predictive marker of response to 
      everolimus therapy.

TI  - Apparent clearance of sirolimus in heart transplant recipients: impact of primary 
      diagnosis and serum lipids.
PG  - 818-26
AB  - The study was aimed to identify factors affecting sirolimus apparent clearance 
      (CL/F) in de novo heart transplant recipients using a population pharmacokinetic 
      approach. A total of 31 patients (7 female and 24 male) originally included in a 
      formal clinical trial, contributed 524 sirolimus blood concentrations with the 
      time after dose ranging from 11.08 to 31.83 hours. Sirolimus concentrations were 
      measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and data analysis 
      was carried out using NONMEM (Globomax LLC, Hanover, MD) software. Factors 
      screened included age, weight, gender, primary diagnosis, biochemical and 
      hematological indices, cyclosporine dose, days post-transplant and potential 
      interacting medications. The predictive performance of the final model was 
      evaluated using a data-splitting method. Sirolimus apparent clearance (CL/F) was 
      decreased by 20.8% for every 100 mg increase in cyclosporine daily dose and was 
      62.1% lower in patients with primary diagnosis of ischemic heart disease (IHD). 
      Sirolimus apparent clearance was 37.8% lower when triglyceride was greater than 2 
      mmol/L. Based on the final model, the average values for sirolimus CL/F and 
      apparent volume of distribution were 7.09 and 1350 L/h, respectively. 
      Inter-subject variability in CL/F was 27.5% and residual random error was 24.1%. 
      This study identified cyclosporine dose, hypertriglyceridemia and primary 
      diagnosis of IHD as the most important factors affecting sirolimus CL/F. This 
      information may assist in dose individualization of sirolimus in heart transplant 
      recipients.

TI  - Influence of cyclosporine and everolimus on the main mycophenolate mofetil 
      pharmacokinetic parameters: Cross-sectional study.
PG  - e6469
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000006469 [doi]
LID - e6469
AB  - The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of cyclosporine (CsA) 
      on the pharmacokinetic parameters of mycophenolic acid (MPA), an active 
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) metabolite, and to compare with the effect of 
      everolimus (EVR).Anonymized medical records of 404 kidney recipients were 
      reviewed. The main MPA pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC(0-12) and Cmax) were 
      evaluated.The patients treated with a higher mean dose of CsA displayed higher 
      MPA AUC(0-12) exposure in the low-dose MMF group (1000 mg/day) (40.50 ± 10.97 vs 
      28.08 ± 11.03 h mg/L; rs = 0.497, P < 0.05), medium-dose MMF group (2000 mg/day) 
      (43.00 ± 6.27 vs 28.85 ± 11.08 h mg/L; rs = 0.437, P < 0.01), and high-dose MMF 
      group (3000 mg/day) (56.75 ± 16.78 vs 36.20 ± 3.70 h mg/L; rs = 0.608, 
      P < 0.05).A positive correlation was also observed between the mean CsA dose and 
      the MPA Cmax in the low-dose MMF group (Cmax 22.83 ± 10.82 vs 12.08 ± 5.59 mg/L; 
      rs = 0.507, P < 0.05) and in the medium-dose MMF group (22.77 ± 8.86 vs 
      13.00 ± 6.82 mg/L; rs = 0.414, P < 0.01).The comparative analysis between 2 
      treatment arms (MMF + CsA and MMF + EVR) showed that MPA AUC(0-12) exposure was 
      by 43% higher in the patients treated with a medium dose of MMF and EVR than in 
      the patients treated with a medium dose of MMF and CsA.The data of the present 
      study suggest a possible CsA versus EVR influence on MMF pharmacokinetics. Study 
      results show that CsA has an impact on the main MPA pharmacokinetic parameters 
      (AUC(0-12) and Cmax) in a CsA dose-related manner, while EVR mildly influence or 
      does not affect MPA pharmacokinetic parameters. Low-dose CsA (lower than 
      180 mg/day) reduces MPA AUC(0-12) exposure under the therapeutic window and may 
      lead to ineffective therapy, while a high-dose CsA (>240 mg/day) is related to 
      greater than 10 mg/L MPA Cmax and increases the likelihood of adverse events.

TI  - A phase I study of bevacizumab (B) in combination with everolimus (E) and 
      erlotinib (E) in advanced cancer (BEE).
PG  - 465-74
LID - 10.1007/s00280-010-1507-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: VEGF, mTOR, and EGFR inhibitors have demonstrated anti-tumor and 
      anti-angiogenic effects alone and in combination with each other. This study 
      evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab, 
      everolimus, and erlotinib combination. METHODS: Doublet therapy consisted of 
      bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg every 14 days and everolimus 5 mg daily which escalated 
      to 10 mg daily. Erlotinib 75 mg daily was added to the phase II dose recommended 
      phase II dose (RPTD) of bevacizumab and everolimus. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) 
      was assessed in cycle 1. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients with advanced solid 
      malignancies were evaluable for DLT and efficacy. No DLTs were observed in the 
      doublet dose escalation. Two DLTs (grade 3 mucositis and grade 3 rash) were 
      observed with the addition of erlotinib 75 mg daily. Consequently, triplet doses 
      were adjusted and were better tolerated. Four patients had a partial response. 
      Median progression-free survival (PFS) for the doublet therapy was 6.0 months 
      (0.5 to 32+ months) and 5.5 months (0.8 to 27+ months) for the triplet therapy. 
      Systemic exposure of everolimus was significantly higher in combination with 
      erlotinib (476 ± 161 ng h/mL) compared to when given alone (393 ± 156 ng h/mL; P 
      = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: The RPTD for the doublet therapy is bevacizumab 10 mg/kg 
      every 14 days and everolimus 10 mg daily, and the RPTD for the triplet therapy is 
      bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 14 days, everolimus 5 mg and erlotinib 75 mg daily. 
      Prolonged disease stability was demonstrated in tumors known to respond to mTOR 
      inhibition and potentially resistant to VEGF blockade.

TI  - Combination mTOR and IGF-1R inhibition: phase I trial of everolimus and 
      figitumumab in patients with advanced sarcomas and other solid tumors.
PG  - 871-9
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2621 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Preclinical models demonstrate synergistic antitumor activity with 
      combination blockade of mTOR and IGF-1R signaling. We aimed to determine the 
      safety, tolerability, and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of 
      figitumumab, a fully human IgG(2) anti-insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor 
      (IGF-1R) monoclonal antibody (Pfizer) and the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus 
      (Novartis). Pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor effects of the combination 
      were evaluated. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Phase I trial in patients with advanced 
      sarcomas and other solid tumors. Initial cohort combined full phase 2 dose 
      figitumumab (20 mg/kg IV every 21 days) with full dose everolimus (10 mg orally 
      once daily). Intercohort dose de-escalation was planned for unacceptable 
      toxicities. Dose modifications were allowed beyond cycle 1. RESULTS: No DLTs were 
      observed in the initial cohort during cycle one, therefore full dose figitumumab 
      and everolimus was declared the RP2D. In total, 21 patients were enrolled on 
      study. Most toxicities were grade 1 or 2, and were similar to reported toxicities 
      of the single agents. Mucositis was the most frequently observed grade 3 
      toxicity. Median time on study was 104 days (range 17-300). Of 18 patients 
      evaluable for response, best response was partial response in 1 patient with 
      malignant solitary fibrous tumor and, stable disease in 15 patients. There were 
      no apparent pharmacokinetic interactions between everolimus and figitumumab. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Combination figitumumab plus everolimus at full doses appears safe 
      and well tolerated with no unexpected toxicities. Dose reductions in everolimus 
      may be required after prolonged drug administration. This regimen exhibits 
      interesting antitumor activity warranting further investigation.

AB  - Background Combinations of molecularly targeted agents may provide optimal 
      anti-tumor activity and improve clinical outcomes for patients with advanced 
      cancers. Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) is an oral, potent and highly 
      selective, allosteric inhibitor of MEK1/2, a component of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK 
      pathway which is constitutively activated in many cancers. We investigated the 
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of selumetinib in combination 
      with molecularly targeted drugs erlotinib or temsirolimus in patients with 
      advanced solid tumors. Methods Two-part study: dose escalation, to determine the 
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of selumetinib in combination with erlotinib 100 mg 
      once daily (QD) or temsirolimus 25 mg once weekly, followed by dose expansion at 
      the respective combination MTDs to further investigate safety and anti-tumor 
      effects. Results 48 patients received selumetinib plus erlotinib and 32 patients 
      received selumetinib plus temsirolimus. The MTD with erlotinib 100 mg QD was 
      selumetinib 100 mg QD, with diarrhea being dose limiting. The most common all 
      grade adverse events (AEs): diarrhea, rash, nausea, and fatigue. Four (8.3%) 
      patients had ≥12 weeks stable disease. The MTD with temsirolimus 25 mg once 
      weekly was selumetinib 50 mg twice daily (BID), with mucositis and neutropenia 
      being dose limiting. The most commonly reported AEs: nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, 
      and mucositis. Ten (31.3%) patients had ≥12 weeks stable disease. The combination 
      PK profiles were comparable to previously observed monotherapy profiles. 
      Conclusions MTDs were established for selumetinib in combination with erlotinib 
      or temsirolimus. Overlapping toxicities prevented the escalation of selumetinib 
      to its recommended phase II monotherapy dose of 75 mg BID. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - A phase Ib trial of continuous once-daily oral afatinib plus sirolimus in

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dysregulation of the downstream PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is a 
      proposed mechanism of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). We investigated safety and antitumor activity of 
      afatinib plus sirolimus as a potential combination to reverse acquired resistance 
      to EGFR-TKIs in a phase IB trial in patients with EGFR mutation-positive 
      non-small-cell lung cancer (EGFR mut NSCLC) and/or disease progression following 
      prior erlotinib/gefitinib. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with EGFR mut NSCLC 
      and/or disease progression following at least prior erlotinib/gefitinib were 
      included in the trial. The primary endpoint was incidence of dose-limiting 
      toxicities (DLT) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Four initial dose 
      cohorts were proposed to evaluate DLTs. Other endpoints included tumor response, 
      safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-nine patients received afatinib and sirolimus. Additional dose cohorts 
      were added since the second cohort (afatinib 40mg/day and sirolimus 5mg/day) was 
      considered to have excessive toxicity. All patients experienced adverse events 
      (AE) [grade 3: 66.7%; serious AE: 56.4%]. The most frequent AEs were diarrhea 
      (94.9%), mucosal inflammation (64.1%), asthenia (53.8%) and rash (53.8%). 
      Discontinuations and dose reduction due to AEs occurred in 23.1% and 25.6% of 
      patients. MTD was determined as afatinib 30mg and sirolimus 1mg. Responses were 
      observed in 5 patients (12.8%) [2 (5.1%) with confirmed partial response (PR); 3 
      (7.7%) with unconfirmed PR], and stable disease in 18 patients (46.2%). Four of 
      the 5 responses were at doses above MTD. PFS at 6 months was estimated in 33.3% 
      (median PFS 3.4 months). Pharmacokinetic parameters of afatinib and sirolimus 
      were similar after single administration or in combination. CONCLUSION: The 
      combination of afatinib and sirolimus showed lower responses than expected. 
      Together with increased AEs and poor tolerability, this precludes clinical use 
      and further clinical development of this combination. No pharmacokinetic 
      interactions were observed. CLINICALTRIALS. GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00993499.

TI  - A phase Ib dose-escalation study of everolimus combined with cisplatin and 
      etoposide as first-line therapy in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung 
      cancer.
PG  - 505-11
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mdt535 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This phase Ib study aimed to establish the feasible everolimus dose 
      given with standard-dose etoposide plus cisplatin (EP) for extensive-stage 
      small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: An adaptive Bayesian 
      dose-escalation model and investigator opinion were used to identify feasible 
      daily or weekly everolimus doses given with EP in adults with treatment-naive 
      extensive-stage SCLC. A protocol amendment mandated prophylactic granulocyte 
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Primary end point was cycle 1 dose-limiting 
      toxicity (DLT) rate. Secondary end points included safety, relative EP dose 
      intensity, pharmacokinetics, and tumor response. RESULTS: Patients received 
      everolimus 2.5 or 5 mg/day without G-CSF (n=10; cohort A), 20 or 30 mg/week 
      without G-CSF (n=18; cohort B), or 2.5 or 5 mg/day with G-CSF (n=12; cohort C); 
      all received EP. Cycle 1 DLT rates were 50.0%, 22.2%, and 16.7% in cohorts A, B, 
      and C, respectively. Cycle 1 DLTs were neutropenia (cohorts A and B), febrile 
      neutropenia (all cohorts), and thrombocytopenia (cohorts A and C). The most 
      common grade 3/4 adverse events were hematologic. Best overall response was 
      partial response (40.0%, 61.1%, and 58.3% in cohorts A, B, and C, respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus 2.5 mg/day plus G-CSF was the only feasible dose given 
      with standard-dose EP in untreated extensive-stage SCLC.

TI  - Phase 1b study of the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor sirolimus in 
      combination with nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel in patients with advanced 
      solid tumors.
PG  - 1817-26
LID - 10.1002/cncr.29254 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal weekly oral dose of sirolimus and intravenous 
      nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) were evaluated. METHODS: A 
      phase 1b study was performed to evaluate escalating doses of oral sirolimus (5-60 
      mg) on days 2, 9, and 16 with intravenous nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m(2) ) on days 
      1, 8, and 15 in a 28-day cycle. A run-in treatment of nab-paclitaxel (day -14) 
      and sirolimus (day -7) was administered for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      assessments. Clinical trial endpoints included dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), 
      maximum tolerated doses, and response rates. Pharmacodynamics included 
      immunohistochemistry for phosphatase and tensin homolog, mammalian target of 
      rapamycin (mTOR), AKT, phosphorylated AKT, S6K1, and phosphorylated S6K1; 
      exploratory gene expression analysis; and [(18) F]fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron 
      emission tomography. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with advanced solid tumors 
      were treated. Fifteen patients had prior taxane therapy. Twenty-two patients were 
      evaluable for responses. One patient had a complete response, and 5 patients had 
      a partial response (3 confirmed). DLTs were seen in 1 patient each at 10 (grade 3 
      dyspnea/hypoxia) and 40 mg (grade 4 leukopenia/neutropenia) and in 2 patients at 
      60 mg (grade 3 fatigue and grade 4 pericardial effusion). Patients with higher 
      expression of posttreatment AKT and a greater decline in FDG activity were more 
      likely to have a treatment response or stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus 
      showed an acceptable safety profile at a weekly dose of 40 mg with weekly 
      intravenous nab-paclitaxel at 100 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. The 
      posttreatment AKT score and changes in FDG activity may have roles as early 
      predictors of responses to mTOR inhibitors.

TI  - Worsening pneumonitis due to a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between 
      everolimus and voriconazole in a renal transplant patient.
PG  - 119-20
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12234 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Azole antifungals, prescribed prophylactically to 
      avoid severe infections in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients, can 
      interact with drug substrates of CYP3A4. We report serious adverse effects due to 
      interaction between orally administered voriconazole and everolimus in a renal 
      transplant recipient. CASE DESCRIPTION: Despite reduction of the dose of 
      everolimus by a third, the blood trough concentration of everolimus increased 
      considerably in a kidney transplant recipient upon oral administration of 
      voriconazole. Everolimus was then discontinued. Pneumonia secondary to pulmonary 
      aspergillosis worsened, possibly due to the excessive immunosuppression. WHAT IS 
      NEW AND CONCLUSION: Orally administered voriconazole inhibits intestinal and 
      hepatic cytochrome P450-3A4 activity and thereby reduces everolimus metabolism. 
      An 80% decrease in dose or discontinuation of everolimus is required when 
      concomitant voriconazole is introduced. Daily blood monitoring of everolimus is 
      warranted until a steady state of concentrations is reached.

TI  - A phase Ib study of everolimus combined with metformin for patients with advanced 
      cancer.
PG  - 53-61
LID - 10.1007/s10637-017-0478-4 [doi]
AB  - Background The efficacy to monotherapy with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in 
      advanced cancer is often limited due to therapy resistance. Combining everolimus 
      with metformin may decrease the chance of therapy resistance. Methods Patients 
      received everolimus and metformin in a 3 + 3 dose-escalation scheme. Objectives 
      were to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose, 
      toxic effects, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumour efficacy. Results 9 patients 
      received study treatment for a median duration of 48 days (range: 4-78). 6 
      patients discontinued due to toxicity and 3 patients because of progressive 
      disease. At the starting dose level of 10 mg everolimus qd and 500 mg metformin 
      bid, 3 out of 5 patients experienced a DLT. After de-escalation to 5 mg 
      everolimus qd and 500 mg metformin bid, considerable toxicity was still observed 
      and patient enrollment was terminated. In pharmacokinetic analyses, metformin was 
      eliminated slower when co-administered with everolimus than as single-agent. 
      After 9 weeks of treatment, 3 patients were still on study and all had stable 
      disease. Conclusion The combination of everolimus and metformin is poorly 
      tolerated in patients with advanced cancer. The pharmacokinetic interaction 
      between everolimus and metformin may have implications for diabetic cancer 
      patients that are treated with these drugs. Our results advocate for future 
      clinical trials with combinations of other mTOR inhibitors and biguanides.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with solid tumours, daily everolimus dosing demonstrated 
      dose proportionality and linear pharmacokinetics. A meta-analysis was conducted 
      to characterise the relationship between everolimus Cmin and efficacy and safety 
      and the effect of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (PgP) substrate/inhibitor/inducer 
      coadministration on everolimus trough concentration (Cmin). METHODS: Individual 
      patient data from five phase 2/3 studies, in which steady state, predose 
      pharmacokinetic samples were taken from patients with solid tumours administered 
      everolimus 10mg/day, were pooled. FINDINGS: Efficacy and safety were evaluable 
      for 945 and 938 patients, respectively. A 2-fold increase in everolimus Cmin 
      increased the likelihood of tumour size reduction (odds ratio 1.40, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 1.23-1.60), was associated with a trend for reduced risk 
      of progression-free survival events (risk ratio [RR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.69-1.18) and 
      increased the risk of grade ⩾3 pulmonary (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.12-3.34), stomatitis 
      (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.05-2.10) and metabolic (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.02-1.65) events. 
      Coadministering everolimus with strong CYP3A4 and PgP inhibitors increased 
      everolimus Cmin by 10% and 20%, respectively; coadministration with CYP3A4 
      inducers reduced Cmin by 7%. INTERPRETATION: A 2-fold increase in everolimus Cmin 
      was associated with improved tumour size reduction and increased risk of 
      high-grade pulmonary, metabolic and stomatitis events. FUNDING: Novartis

TI  - CYP3A5*3 influences sirolimus oral clearance in de novo and stable renal 
      transplant recipients.
PG  - 51-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: The low and highly variable oral bioavailability of the 
      immunosuppressant sirolimus is thought to result partly from genetic polymorphism 
      of the CYP3A5 gene. METHODS: This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of the 
      CYP3A5 single-nucleotide polymorphism A6986G to the interindividual variability 
      of sirolimus pharmacokinetics in 47 renal transplant patients at steady state, 21 
      of whom were also followed up for the first 3 months after transplantation. The 
      patients were administered sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids 
      but no calcineurin inhibitor. They were genotyped for CYP3A5*3 by use of 
      real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction based on the 5'-nuclease allelic 
      discrimination assay. Full sirolimus blood concentration profiles were measured 
      at steady state (3 months after transplantation or more) in all patients, as well 
      as at weeks 1 and 2 and month 1 in 21 of these patients, by use of liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The sirolimus area under the 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) was calculated via the standard noncompartmental 
      approach. Maximal concentration (C(max)) and trough level (C(0)) values were 
      measured. RESULTS: Significantly lower AUC/dose, C(max)/dose, and C(0)/dose 
      values were found at steady state (n = 47) in individuals carrying at least 1 
      CYP3A5*1 allele (n = 6) than in *3/*3 patients (26.6 +/- 15.7 versus 51.1 +/- 
      21.1 [P = .008], 4.8 +/- 3.3 versus 7.7 +/- 3.3 [P = .02], and 1.5 +/- 0.8 versus 
      3.0 +/- 1.5 [P = .01], respectively), as well as during all posttransplant 
      periods in the subgroup of 21 patients who were followed up for the first 3 
      months after transplantation (n = 21) (P < .05 always). Patients with the 
      CYP3A5*1/*1 and *1/*3 genotypes required a significantly higher sirolimus daily 
      dose to achieve the same blood concentration at steady state as *3/*3 patients. 
      In patients followed up for the first 3 months after transplantation, C(0) levels 
      within the target range were only achieved after 1 to 3 months of repeated dosing 
      and dose adjustment in both genotypic groups. CONCLUSION: These results confirm 
      that sirolimus metabolic activity and oral clearance are significantly decreased 
      in patients who are homozygous for the CYP3A5*3 single-nucleotide polymorphism 
      and suggest that the determination of this polymorphism could be useful for a 
      priori dose adjustment of sirolimus, given the long half-life of this drug.

TI  - A comparative study of sirolimus tablet versus oral solution for prophylaxis of 
      acute renal allograft rejection.
PG  - 76-87
AB  - This multicenter, open-label study compared the efficacy, safety, and 
      pharmacokinetic parameters of sirolimus (rapamycin) tablet and liquid 
      formulations for prevention of efficacy failure. A total of 477 renal allograft 
      recipients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either tablet or solution 
      formulations of sirolimus for 12 months, plus cyclosporine (CsA) and steroids. 
      Pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed based on trough concentrations and 
      24-hour pharmacokinetic profiles. There were no significant differences in 
      efficacy failure at 3 or 12 months between tablet and solution groups. Graft 
      survival, patient survival, rate of first biopsy-confirmed acute rejection, time 
      to and severity of acute rejection, and laboratory parameters were not 
      significantly different between groups. Mean steady-state sirolimus and CsA 
      pharmacokinetic parameters on days 30 and 90 were not significantly different by 
      formulation, except for longer sirolimus t(max) after tablet administration. 
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that low sirolimus C(min,TN) 
      and more human leukocyte antigen mismatches were predictors of acute rejection. 
      The tablet and solution formulations of sirolimus demonstrated therapeutic 
      equivalence.

TI  - A phase I study of temozolomide and everolimus (RAD001) in patients with newly 
      diagnosed and progressive glioblastoma either receiving or not receiving 
      enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants: an NCIC CTG study.
PG  - 2344-51
LID - 10.1007/s10637-011-9775-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This phase I trial was designed to determine the recommended phase II 
      dose(s) of everolimus (RAD001) with temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with 
      glioblastoma (GBM). Patients receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs 
      (EIAEDs) and those not receiving EIAEDs (NEIAEDs) were studied separately. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Enrollment was restricted to patients with proven GBM, 
      either newly diagnosed or at first progression. Temozolomide was administered at 
      a starting dose of 150 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days every 28 days, and everolimus was 
      administered continuously at a starting dose of 2.5 mg orally on a daily schedule 
      starting on day 2 of cycle 1 in 28-day cycles. RESULTS: Thirteen patients 
      receiving EIAEDs and 19 not receiving EIAEDs were enrolled and received 83 and 
      116 cycles respectively. Everolimus 10 mg daily plus TMZ 150 mg/m(2)/day for 5 
      days was declared the recommended phase II dose for the NEIAEDs cohort. In the 
      EIAEDs group, doses were well tolerated without DLTs, and pharmacokinetic 
      parameters indicated decreased everolimus exposure. Temozolomide pharmacokinetic 
      parameters were unaffected by EIAEDs or everolimus. In the subset of 28 patients 
      with measurable disease, 3 had partial responses (all NEIAEDs) and 16 had stable 
      disease. CONCLUSION: A dosage of 10 mg everolimus daily with TMZ 150 mg/m(2)/day 
      for five consecutive days every 28 days in patients is the recommended dose for 
      this regimen. Everolimus clearance is increased by EIAEDs, and patients receiving 
      EIAEDs should be switched to NEIAEDs before starting this regimen.

TI  - Lack of meaningful effect of ridaforolimus on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam 
      in cancer patients: model prediction and clinical confirmation.
PG  - 1256-62
LID - 10.1002/jcph.331 [doi]
AB  - Ridaforolimus, a unique non-prodrug analog of rapamycin, is a potent inhibitor of 
      mTOR under development for cancer treatment. In vitro data suggest ridaforolimus 
      is a reversible and time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A. A model-based evaluation 
      suggested an increase in midazolam area under the curve (AUC(0- ∞)) of between 
      1.13- and 1.25-fold in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of 
      ridaforolimus. The pharmacokinetic interaction between multiple oral doses of 
      ridaforolimus and a single oral dose of midazolam was evaluated in an open-label, 
      fixed-sequence study, in which cancer patients received a single oral dose of 2 
      mg midazolam followed by 5 consecutive daily single oral doses of 40 mg 
      ridaforolimus with a single dose of 2 mg midazolam with the fifth ridaforolimus 
      dose. Changes in midazolam exposure were minimal [geometric mean ratios and 90% 
      confidence intervals: 1.23 (1.07, 1.40) for AUC(0-∞) and 0.92 (0.82, 1.03) for 
      maximum concentrations (C(max)), respectively]. Consistent with model 
      predictions, ridaforolimus had no clinically important effect on midazolam 
      pharmacokinetics and is not anticipated to be a perpetrator of drug-drug 
      interactions (DDIs) when coadministered with CYP3A substrates. Model-based 
      approaches can provide reasonable estimates of DDI liability, potentially 
      obviating the need to conduct dedicated DDI studies especially in challenging 
      populations like cancer patients.

TI  - Phase II study of sirolimus in treatment-naive patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 610-6
LID - 10.1016/j.dld.2012.02.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapalogs are emerging as promising targeted anticancer drugs. 
      Activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway has been observed in 15-50% of 
      hepatocellular carcinomas. METHODS: In this phase II study, patients with 
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and underlying cirrhosis received sirolimus (20 
      mg/week for 1 month then 30 mg/week). Tumour response was assessed every 8 weeks. 
      The primary endpoint was the objective tumour response rate according to the 
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours criteria. Secondary endpoints 
      included the objective response according to the modified Response Evaluation 
      Criteria in Solid Tumours criteria, safety, and pharmacokinetic parameters. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-five patients received sirolimus for a median of 20.6 weeks. Two 
      patients had an objective response (8%, 95CI: 0.98-26.03), including one complete 
      response, and 8 patients had stable disease. There were 2 cases of grade 5 
      toxicity (infections) and 5 cases of grade 3 toxicity. The main grade 1/2 
      toxicity was mild transient fatigue (76%). Median time to radiological 
      progression and overall survival were 15.3 weeks (range: 8.2-173.9) and 26.4 
      weeks (range: 8.2-173.9) respectively. Use of the modified Response Evaluation 
      Criteria in Solid Tumours criteria did not identify any further responders. 
      CONCLUSION: These data suggest that first-line sirolimus shows antitumoural 
      efficacy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Larger trials with Child A 
      patients are needed.

TI  - Effectiveness of sirolimus in combination with cyclosporine against chronic 
      rejection in a pediatric liver transplant patient.
PG  - 1221-5
AB  - The patient is a 3-year-old boy who received living-donor liver transplantation 
      (LDLT) for hepatoblastoma, with his mother as the donor. Oral tacrolimus was 
      started at a dose of 0.3 mg every 12 h from day 1, with the dosage adjusted on 
      the basis of trough concentrations. The levels of aspartate aminotransferase 
      (AST), alanine transferase (ALT), and total bilirubin (T-bil) were 110 U/L, 
      182 U/L, and 12.6 mg/dL, respectively, when chronic rejection (CR) was 
      pathologically diagnosed. Then, sirolimus at a dose of 1.0 mg/d was added to the 
      tacrolimus-based regimen. The T-bil level rapidly decreased to 5.4 mg/dL, without 
      changes in AST and ALT. Because the intracellular receptor of sirolimus and 
      tacrolimus is FK506-binding protein 12, we switched tacrolimus to cyclosporine at 
      a dose of 60 mg/d to avoid competitive inhibition between these 2 drugs. The 
      target trough concentration of sirolimus and cyclosporine was set to around 
      15 ng/mL and 180 ng/mL, respectively. The concentration/dose ratio of sirolimus 
      was significantly correlated with the blood cyclosporine level (r=0.5293, 
      p<0.05), suggesting the pharmacokinetic interaction between these 2 drugs. 
      Thereafter, the levels of AST and ALT as well as the T-bil were successfully 
      decreased to 73 U/L, 83 U/L, and 3.0 mg/dL, respectively. These results suggest 
      that sirolimus therapy in combination with cyclosporine may be an effective 
      treatment against CR after liver transplantation.

TI  - Phase I or II Study of Ribociclib in Combination With Topotecan-Temozolomide or 
      Everolimus in Children With Advanced Malignancies: Arms A and B of the 
      AcSé-ESMART Trial.
PG  - 3546-3560
LID - 10.1200/JCO.21.01152 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: AcSé-ESMART is a proof-of-concept, phase I or II, platform trial, 
      designed to explore targeted agents in a molecularly enriched cancer population. 
      Arms A and B aimed to define the recommended phase II dose and activity of the 
      CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib with topotecan and temozolomide (TOTEM) or 
      everolimus, respectively, in children with recurrent or refractory malignancies. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ribociclib was administered orally once daily for 16 days 
      after TOTEM for 5 days (arm A) or for 21 days with everolimus orally once daily 
      continuously in a 28-day cycle (arm B). Dose escalation followed the continuous 
      reassessment method, and activity assessment the Ensign design. Arms were 
      enriched on the basis of molecular alterations in the cell cycle or PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
      pathways. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included, 14 in arm A and 18 in arm 
      B, and 31 were treated. Fourteen patients had sarcomas (43.8%), and 13 brain 
      tumors (40.6%). Main toxicities were leukopenia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia. 
      The recommended phase II dose was ribociclib 260 mg/m(2) once a day, temozolomide 
      100 mg/m(2) once a day, and topotecan 0.5 mg/m(2) once a day (arm A) and 
      ribociclib 175 mg/m(2) once a day and everolimus 2.5 mg/m(2) once a day (arm B). 
      Pharmacokinetic analyses confirmed the drug-drug interaction of ribociclib on 
      everolimus exposure. Two patients (14.3%) had stable disease as best response in 
      arm A, and seven (41.2%) in arm B, including one patient with T-acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia with significant blast count reduction. Alterations 
      considered for enrichment were present in 25 patients (81%) and in eight of nine 
      patients with stable disease; the leukemia exhibited CDKN2A/B and PTEN 
      deficiency. CONCLUSION: Ribociclib in combination with TOTEM or everolimus was 
      well-tolerated. The observed activity signals initiated a follow-up study of the 
      ribociclib-everolimus combination in a population enriched with molecular 
      alterations within both pathways.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and tissue 
      effects of everolimus delivered into arterial wall using biodegradable 
      nanospheres. BACKGROUND: Delivery of everolimus into the arterial wall is 
      challenging due to its low-lipophilic profile. METHODS: A pharmacokinetic study 
      included 28 porcine coronary arterial segments initially injured with balloon 
      angioplasty followed by the local delivery of everolimus encapsulated in 
      nanospheres (EEN) via injection through a microporous delivery catheter. The 
      animals were sacrificed at 1 hour, 1,7,28, and 90-day follow-up. In the tissue 
      effects study 16 coronary bare metal stent (BMS) were implanted following EEN 
      delivery, 15 BMS following nanospheres delivery without the drug (reference 
      group) and 16 implanted BMS served as a control. Angiographic and histology 
      follow-up was scheduled at 28 and 90-day. RESULTS: The study showed 
      high-everolimus concentrations in arterial tissue early after nanoparticles 
      delivery followed by its gradual decrease to 1.15 ± 0.40 ng/mg at 90 days. 
      Histology analysis showed favorable biocompatibility and healing profile with 
      comparable area stenosis between groups at both time-points. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      present study demonstrates for the first time the safety, biocompatibility, and 
      long-term retention of everolimus in arterial tissue after single local delivery 
      of biodegradable nanospheres.

TI  - Phase I clinical trial of the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus 
      in combination with oral topotecan for recurrent and advanced endometrial cancer.
PG  - 528-33

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Preclinical data suggest that mammalian target of rapamycin 
      inhibitors may potentiate the efficacy of topotecan. We evaluated the optimal 
      schedule of oral topotecan in combination with everolimus in patients with 
      endometrial cancer. METHODS: Women with a history of advanced or recurrent 
      endometrial cancer were enrolled. Escalating dose of oral topotecan (1.5 mg/m, 
      1.9 mg/m, and 2.3 mg/m) daily on days 1 to 5 and everolimus (5 mg every other 
      day, 5 mg daily, and 10 mg daily) were administered in a 21-day cycle. A "run-in" 
      treatment of topotecan daily for 5 days followed by everolimus for 7 days (4-7 
      doses depending on dose level) was administered for the purpose of 
      pharmacokinetic assessments. RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled on the study, 
      and 9 were evaluable for safety analysis. A total of 28 cycles were administered 
      (range, 1-10 cycles per patient). The patients had a median age of 73 years 
      (range, 42-79 years). Previous lines of chemotherapy were 1 (n = 2), 2 (n = 5), 3 
      (n = 2), and 4 (n = 1). Seven patients had previous vaginal brachytherapy, and 2 
      had pelvic external beam radiation therapy. The median number of cycles 
      (including cycle 1) is 2 (range, 1-10). Dose-limiting toxicity occurred in 3 
      patients (1 patient treated with 1.9-mg/m topotecan and 5-mg everolimus given 
      every other day as well as 2 patients treated with 1.9-mg/m topotecan and 5-mg of 
      everolimus daily) and included neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Seven patients 
      were evaluable for response. Stable disease was the best response in 3 patients 
      who completed the 3, 4, and 10 cycles each. CONCLUSIONS: The dose-limiting 
      toxicity for the combination of oral topotecan and everolimus was 
      myelosuppression. The maximum tolerated dose was topotecan 1.9 mg/m on days 1 to 
      5 in combination with oral everolimus 5 mg every other day. Administration of 
      higher dose of each agent in combination was limited because of overlapping 
      myelosuppression.

TI  - Intestinal absorption and intestinal lymphatic transport of sirolimus from 
      self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems assessed using the single-pass 
      intestinal perfusion (SPIP) technique and a chylomicron flow blocking approach: 
      linear correlation with oral bioavailabilities in rats.
PG  - 132-40
LID - 10.1016/j.ejps.2011.04.011 [doi]
AB  - This work aims to investigate the impact of different amount of oil or surfactant 
      included in self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems on the intestinal 
      lymphatic transport of sirolimus using the single-pass intestinal perfusion 
      (SPIP) technique and a chylomicron flow blocking approach. Male Sprague-Dawley 
      rats were pretreated intraperitoneally with 3.0mg/kg cycloheximide or saline. One 
      hour later, single-pass intestinal perfusion experiments in jejunum and ileum and 
      in vivo bioavailability studies were carried out to calculate the effective 
      permeability coefficient and pharmacokinetic parameters, respectively. Drug 
      absorption from oil-free formulation was mostly via the portal blood. In 
      contrast, for the SMEDDS formulations containing ≥25% MCT, the lymphatic 
      transport of sirolimus was a major contributor to oral bioavailability. The 
      formulation including more content of oil presented higher lymphatic transport of 
      drug and further exhibited the increased oral bioavailability. Besides, distal 
      ileum presented much more lymphatic transport of drug compared to proximal 
      jejunum. Furthermore, even though the smaller droplet size of resultant 
      microemulsions and more surfactant content also can positively influence the 
      intestinal absorption of drug, their influences on the drug intestinal lymphatic 
      transport were relatively weaker than that of more oil content. In addition, 
      there was a high linear correlation between the AUC values and the mean of P(eff) 
      values in jejunum and ileum.

TI  - Entry-into-human study with the novel immunosuppressant SDZ RAD in stable renal 
      transplant recipients.
PG  - 694-703
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the tolerability of single oral SDZ RAD doses in stable renal 
      transplant recipients and the pharmacokinetics of ascending SDZ RAD doses when 
      coadministered with steady-state cyclosporin A microemulsion (Neoral). METHODS: 
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential study involved 54 
      patients in six treatment groups; a different SDZ RAD dose (0.25, 0. 75, 2.5, 
      7.5, 15, 25 mg) was assessed in each group. Patients received a single oral dose 
      of SDZ RAD (n=6) or placebo (n=3) with their usual Neoral dose. SDZ RAD and 
      cyclosporin A pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. RESULTS: All SDZ RAD 
      doses were well tolerated, with no discontinuations due to adverse events, 
      serious adverse events, or deaths. Similar proportions of patients receiving SDZ 
      RAD and placebo had at least one adverse event (44% and 50%, respectively). Mean 
      changes in laboratory variables (baseline to endpoint) showed no clinically 
      meaningful differences between SDZ RAD and placebo groups. SDZ RAD was absorbed 
      rapidly and showed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics (dose: 2.5-25 mg), based on 
      systemic exposure. Multiple postabsorptive phases in the pharmacokinetic profile 
      indicate tissue distribution. The elimination half-life ranged from 24 to 35 h 
      across the five highest dose groups. Pharmacokinetics were similar in men and 
      women. Co-administration of escalating single oral SDZ RAD doses did not affect 
      steady-state cyclosporin A pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSIONS: SDZ RAD was well 
      tolerated; safety profiles of SDZ RAD and placebo were similar. SDZ RAD 
      pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional across the range 2.5-25 mg in conjunction 
      with cyclosporin A-based therapy, according to systemic exposure. Cyclosporin A 
      pharmacokinetics were not affected by coadministration of single oral doses of 
      0.25-25 mg SDZ RAD.

TI  - A phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate safety and tolerability of sorafenib 
      combined with sirolimus in patients with advanced solid cancer.
PG  - 1637-43
LID - 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605777 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of sorafenib (vascular endothelial growth factor 
      receptor 2 inhibitor) and sirolimus (mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor) 
      might work synergistically. METHODS: A phase I dose-escalation study with 
      sorafenib twice a day (b.i.d.) and sirolimus once daily (q.d.) was performed to 
      determine the recommended dose of the combination in patients with solid tumours. 
      Secondary objectives were to determine the safety profile and maximum tolerated 
      dose (MTD), and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination. 
      RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicities were transaminitis and cutaneous toxicity. The 
      most frequently reported adverse events were elevated transaminases, 
      hypophosphatemia, fatigue, anorexia, diarrhoea, nausea, rash and palmar-plantar 
      erythrodysaesthesia. Sirolimus did not change the PK of sorafenib; in contrast, 
      sorafenib reduced the AUC(0-96) and C(max) of sirolimus. No objective responses 
      were observed; eight patients showed stable disease for a median of 16.3 weeks 
      (range 8-24). The MTD of the combination was sorafenib 200  mg b.i.d. with 
      sirolimus 1 mg q.d. CONCLUSION: The combination of sorafenib and sirolimus showed 
      enhanced toxicity, which could not be explained by the PK of both drugs. The 
      relative low doses at the MTD, in combination with the PK results, do not warrant 
      further development of this combination.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of sirolimus-eluting stents implanted in the neonatal arterial 
      duct.
LID - e002233 [pii]
LID - 10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.114.002233 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sirolimus-eluting stents may have clinical advantages over bare-metal 
      stents in the extremely proliferative environment of the neonatal arterial duct. 
      However, sirolimus has immunosuppressive actions and little is known regarding 
      sirolimus pharmacokinetics in the newborn. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a 
      retrospective review of sirolimus pharmacokinetics in neonates who underwent 
      sirolimus-eluting stent implantation in the arterial duct for pulmonary blood 
      flow augmentation. Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained by noncompartmental 
      analysis and by a Bayesian one-compartment nonlinear mixed model. Nine neonates 
      received a single sirolimus-eluting stent with a total sirolimus dose of 245 μg 
      (n = 1), 194 μg (n = 5), or 143 μg (n = 3). Peak sirolimus concentrations were 
      13.6 ± 4.5 μg/L (24.8 μg/L highest) and clearance was 0.042 ± 0.03 L/hour 
      (noncompartmental analysis) and 0.051 L/hour (95% credible intervals 0.037-0.069, 
      nonlinear mixed model). Sirolimus remained > 5 μg/L, the trough level used in 
      oral immunosuppressive therapy, for (95% credible interval) 15.9 (11.4, 22.8), 
      12.9 (7.6, 19.0), and 8.4 (2.3, 14.5) days for the 245, 194, and 143 μg sirolimus 
      dose stents, respectively. Estimates of the duration of systemic 
      immunosuppression are provided for combinations of 2 stents. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      neonates after sirolimus-eluting stent implantation, peak sirolimus levels were 
      20 × higher and clearance 30 × lower than previously reported in older children 
      and adults. Sirolimus levels were within the immunosuppressive range for a 
      prolonged period, but with no observable clinically significant adverse outcomes.

TI  - Enhanced supersaturation and oral absorption of sirolimus using an amorphous 
      solid dispersion based on Eudragit® e.
PG  - 9496-509
LID - 10.3390/molecules20069496 [doi]
AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the effect of Eudragit® E/HCl (E-SD) on 
      the degradation of sirolimus in simulated gastric fluid (pH 1.2) and to develop a 
      new oral formulation of sirolimus using E-SD solid dispersions to enhance oral 
      bioavailability. Sirolimus-loaded solid dispersions were fabricated by a spray 
      drying process. A kinetic solubility test demonstrated that the 
      sirolimus/E-SD/TPGS (1/8/1) solid dispersion had a maximum solubility of 196.7 
      μg/mL within 0.5 h that gradually decreased to 173.4 μg/mL after 12 h. According 
      to the dissolution study, the most suitable formulation was the 
      sirolimus/E-SD/TPGS (1/8/1) solid dispersion in simulated gastric fluid (pH 1.2), 
      owing to enhanced stability and degree of supersaturation of E-SD and TPGS. 
      Furthermore, pharmacokinetic studies in rats indicated that compared to the 
      physical mixture and sirolimus/HPMC/TPGS (1/8/1) solid dispersion, the 
      sirolimus/E-SD/TPGS (1/8/1) solid dispersion significantly improved oral 
      absorption of sirolimus. E-SD significantly inhibited the degradation of 
      sirolimus in a dose-dependent manner. E-SD also significantly inhibited the 
      precipitation of sirolimus compared to hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC). 
      Therefore, the results from the present study suggest that the sirolimus-loaded 
      E-SD/TPGS solid dispersion has great potential in clinical applications.

TI  - A phase I study of daily everolimus plus low-dose weekly cisplatin for patients 
      with advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 591-8
LID - 10.1007/s00280-011-1734-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Preclinical studies demonstrate synergistic anti-tumor activity with the 
      combination of everolimus and cisplatin. We conducted a phase I study to 
      establish the recommended phase II of oral everolimus to be given with low-dose 
      weekly intravenous cisplatin. METHODS: Part A used a standard 3 + 3 dose 
      escalation scheme. There were 4 planned dose levels of everolimus: 2.5, 5, 7.5, 
      and 10 mg/day. Subjects received oral everolimus during days 1-21 and cisplatin 
      20 mg/m(2) intravenously (fixed dose) on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. 
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples were collected on day 1 and day 8 of cycle 1 
      in Part A. After the phase II recommended dose was established (Part A), 6 
      additional subjects were enrolled in an expansion cohort (Part B). Response was 
      assessed by RECIST q 2 cycles for all subjects. RESULTS: Thirty patients were 
      enrolled (18 male, 12 female) and 29 were treated. Median age was 61 years 
      (31-79) and the median number of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens was 2 
      (0-3). Eighty-three percent of subjects had received prior RT. DLTs occurred at 
      dose level 1 (sudden death of unclear cause in a patient with melanoma metastatic 
      to liver) and dose level 2 (bowel obstruction). No DLTs occurred at dose levels 3 
      and 4. The most common adverse events (≥grade 3) among 28 patients evaluable for 
      toxicity were lymphopenia (36%), hyperglycemia (11%), fatigue (11%), and venous 
      thrombosis (11%). PK analysis of everolimus demonstrated dose-proportional 
      increases in C (max) (mean 91.9 ng/ml) and AUC(0-INF) (mean 680.5 h*ng/ml) at 
      dose level 4. Three partial responses were seen (metastatic pulmonary carcinoid, 
      n = 2; metastatic sinus carcinoma, n = 1). Prolonged stable disease ≥6 cycles 
      occurred in subjects with pulmonary carcinoid, oropharyngeal squamous cell 
      carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and 
      esthesioneuroblastoma (n = 1 each). CONCLUSION: The phase II recommended dose is 
      everolimus 10 mg/day (days 1-21) + cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) (days 1, 8, and 15) of a 
      28-day cycle. PK data demonstrate dose-proportional increases in exposure, as 
      previously described for everolimus monotherapy. Anti-tumor activity was observed 
      in several tumor types.

AB  - Based on the present findings, a number of preliminary conclusions can be made 
      regarding the distribution, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic range 
      investigations with RAPA: (a) the majority of the drug is sequestered in 
      erythrocytes, resulting in whole blood concentrations; (b) the drug has a 
      relatively long half-life in both humans and animals with 24-hour trough 
      concentrations being within the analytical range of HPLC when immunosuppressive 
      doses are administered; (c) the drug exhibits a proportionality between trough 
      concentrations and dose; (d) trough concentrations of the drug appear to be 
      related to immunosuppressive efficacy and drug-related side effects. The studies 
      described here should provide a basis for the establishment of therapeutic 
      monitoring protocols for RAPA.

TI  - Intravenous temsirolimus in cancer patients: clinical pharmacology and dosing 
      considerations.
PG  - S18-25
LID - 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2009.10.009 [doi]
AB  - Temsirolimus, a highly specific inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin 
      (mTOR), is a novel anticancer targeted therapy with a new mechanism of action. 
      The prototype mTOR inhibitor, oral rapamycin, is poorly soluble and undergoes 
      extensive first-pass metabolism, leading to low and potentially variable 
      absorption and exposure. For some tumors, maximizing the bioavailability and dose 
      intensity via intravenous (IV) administration may provide optimal clinical 
      benefit. Temsirolimus is an ester analog of rapamycin that retains its potent 
      intrinsic mTOR inhibitory activity while exhibiting better solubility for IV 
      formulation. In the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, temsirolimus is 
      administered as a 30- to 60-minute IV infusion once weekly at a flat dose of 25 
      mg. This dosage results in high peak temsirolimus concentrations and limited 
      immunosuppressive activity. Because temsirolimus is active and well tolerated, 
      different dosages and schedules are being explored for other solid and 
      hematologic malignancies, including mantle cell lymphoma. Temsirolimus exhibits a 
      high volume of distribution that, together with IV administration, leads to 
      extensive distribution into peripheral tissues. In addition, significant and 
      protracted exposures are attained with sirolimus (rapamycin), the major 
      equipotent metabolite of temsirolimus. Whereas temsirolimus and sirolimus are 
      both metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, drug interaction studies with 
      agents that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 activity indicate that exposure to the 
      sirolimus metabolite is somewhat sensitive to pharmacokinetic (PK) drug 
      interaction. Therefore, temsirolimus dose adjustments are warranted if 
      coadministration cannot be avoided. Despite its complexity, the PK profile of IV 
      temsirolimus is well characterized in cancer patients and provides a strong basis 
      for its future study as a monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer 
      agents.

      carcinoma.
PG  - 1868-76
LID - 10.1002/cncr.26429 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Simultaneous inhibition of the vascular epithelial growth factor 
      (VEGF) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway may improve treatment 
      response in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Everolimus, an oral mTOR 
      inhibitor, and sunitinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGF, are 
      standard agents in the management of metastatic RCC. METHODS: Sequential cohorts 
      of 3 to 6 patients with advanced RCC received dose-escalated combinations of 
      sunitinib (37.5 or 50 mg daily, 4 weeks on/2 weeks off) with everolimus (2.5-5 mg 
      daily or 20-30 mg weekly). Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed in the 
      first 6-week cycle to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Pharmacokinetic 
      profiles were obtained. RESULTS: Twenty patients (13 clear cell and 7 nonclear 
      cell RCC) were enrolled in 5 cohorts. Daily everolimus was not tolerated when 
      combined with sunitinib; the first 2 patients on the second cohort suffered DLTs. 
      With weekly everolimus, the MTD was 30 mg everolimus on days 7, 14, 21, and 28, 
      plus 37.5 mg sunitinib on days 1 to 28 of a 42-day cycle; however, chronic 
      treatment was associated with grade 3 and 4 toxicities. A schedule of 20 mg 
      everolimus weekly/37.5 mg sunitinib was tolerated as chronic therapy. Five 
      patients (25%) had confirmed partial responses, and 3 had nonclear cell RCC. No 
      unexpected accumulation of everolimus, sunitinib, or N-desethyl sunitinib was 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of everolimus and sunitinib is associated 
      with significant acute and chronic toxicities and is only tolerated at attenuated 
      doses. Responses were observed in nonclear cell and clear cell RCC.

PG  - 467-80

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Everolimus is a novel macrolide immunosuppressant used 
      in the prevention of acute and chronic rejection of solid organ transplants. 
      Everolimus is being actively investigated worldwide as a non-nephrotoxic 
      alternative for calcineurin inhibitors. Its highly variable pharmacokinetics and 
      narrow therapeutic window make it difficult to maintain an adequate exposure to 
      prevent serious adverse effects. The primary objective of this study was to 
      improve prediction of everolimus systemic exposure in renal transplant patients 
      by describing the pharmacokinetics of everolimus and identifying the influence of 
      demographic factors and a selection of polymorphisms in genes coding for ABCB1, 
      CYP3A5, CYP2C8 and PXR. The secondary objective of this study was to develop a 
      limited sampling strategy to enable prediction of everolimus exposure in an 
      efficient way and to compare it with the widely used trough blood concentration 
      (C(trough)) monitoring. METHODS: A total of 783 blood samples were obtained from 
      53 renal transplant patients who had been switched from a triple therapy of 
      ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone to a calcineurin 
      inhibitor-free dual therapy of everolimus (twice daily) and prednisolone. 
      Everolimus blood concentrations were analysed in whole blood using liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry during routine therapeutic drug 
      monitoring targeting an area under the blood concentration-time curve from time 
      zero to 12 hours (AUC(12)) of 120 μg · h/L. A population pharmacokinetic model 
      was developed and demographic factors and genetic polymorphisms in genes coding 
      for ABCB1, CYP3A5, CYP2C8 and PXR were included as covariates. In addition, a 
      limited sampling strategy was developed. RESULTS: Maintaining everolimus systemic 
      exposure at an AUC(12) of 120 μg · h/L resulted in low rejection rates but 
      considerable numbers of adverse events and toxicity. Everolimus pharmacokinetics 
      were best described by a two-compartment model with lag-time (oral clearance = 
      17.9 L/h; volume of distribution of the central compartment after oral 
      administration [V(1)/F] = 148 L and first-order absorption rate constant [k(a)] = 
      7.36 h-1). Ideal body weight was significantly related to V(1)/F. None of the 
      selected polymorphisms in genes coding for enzymes involved in distribution and 
      metabolism of everolimus had a significant influence on everolimus 
      pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetic limited sampling model (C(trough) and whole 
      blood drug concentration at 2 hours postdose [C(2)]) resulted in a significantly 
      improved prediction of everolimus exposure compared with the widely used 
      C(trough) monitoring. CONCLUSION: A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with 
      lag-time describing the concentration-time profile of oral everolimus in renal 
      transplant patients has been developed using pharmacokinetic modelling. Ideal 
      body weight significantly influenced V(1)/F of everolimus; however, the selected 
      polymorphisms in genes coding for ABCB1, CYP3A5, CYP2C8 and PXR had no clinically 
      relevant effect on everolimus pharmacokinetics. Everolimus C(trough) and C(2) as 
      a limited sampling model can be used to accurately estimate everolimus systemic 
      exposure, an improvement over the widely used C(trough) monitoring.

AB  - PURPOSE: Anti-angiogenic and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors have shown 
      efficacy in solid tumours. Reported combination of both drugs was deemed to be 
      too toxic. Due to a potential favourable safety profile of axitinib (AX), a phase 
      I study combining everolimus (EV) and AX for solid tumours was explored. 
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (pts) with advanced cancers were enrolled in an 
      escalation phase I study to investigate the safety of the combination. 
      Pharmacokinetic profile and functional vascular imaging were performed. An 
      extension to pts with naive metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) was explored. 
      RESULTS: 15 pts were included over three different dose levels (DLs); DL 0: AX 
      3 mg BID (twice daily)/EV 5 mg OD (once daily); DL 1: AX 5 mg BID/EV 5 mg OD and 
      DL 2: AX 5 mg BID/EV 10 mg OD for 28 d. One dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was 
      reported at DL 0: grade (Gr) III diarrhoea and one DLT at DL 2: Gr III asthenia. 
      Three severe adverse events (AEs) in two pts were unexpected: jaw osteonecrosis, 
      recurrent renal failure and cardiomyopathy. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 
      level 2. After 1st cycle, Gr III or Gr II AEs of interest were mainly asthenia, 
      diarrhoea and anorexia. All pts but one showed tumour shrinkage. Partial 
      responses (PRs) were seen in one pt with bladder carcinoma and in one pt in 1st 
      line MRCC in the escalating phase. In the extension phase in naive MRCC treated 
      at MTD, five pts had a PR and one pt had a prolonged stable disease. CONCLUSION: 
      The recommended dose for phase II is AX 5 mg BID/EV 10 mg OD.

AB  - Paclitaxel and rapamycin have been reported to act synergistically to treat 
      breast cancer. Albeit paclitaxel is available for breast cancer treatment, the 
      most commonly used formulation in the clinic presents side effects, limiting its 
      use. Furthermore, both drugs present pharmacokinetics drawbacks limiting their in 
      vivo efficacy and clinic combination. As an alternative, drug delivery systems, 
      particularly liposomes, emerge as an option for drug combination, able to 
      simultaneously deliver co-loaded drugs with improved therapeutic index. 
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop and characterize a co-loaded 
      paclitaxel and rapamycin liposome and evaluate it for breast cancer efficacy both 
      in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that a SPC/Chol/DSPE-PEG (2000) liposome was 
      able to co-encapsulate paclitaxel and rapamycin with suitable encapsulation 
      efficiency values, nanometric particle size, low polydispersity and neutral zeta 
      potential. Taken together, FTIR and thermal analysis evidenced drug conversion to 
      the more bioavailable molecular and amorphous forms, respectively, for paclitaxel 
      and rapamycin. The pegylated liposome exhibited excellent colloidal stability and 
      was able to retain drugs encapsulated, which were released in a slow and 
      sustained fashion. Liposomes were more cytotoxic to 4T1 breast cancer cell line 
      than the free drugs and drugs acted synergistically, particularly when co-loaded. 
      Finally, in vivo therapeutic evaluation carried out in 4T1-tumor-bearing mice 
      confirmed the in vitro results. The co-loaded paclitaxel/rapamycin pegylated 
      liposome better controlled tumor growth compared to the solution. Therefore, we 
      expect that the formulation developed herein might be a contribution for future 
      studies focusing on the clinical combination of paclitaxel and rapamycin.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sirolimus has been used to treat paediatric kaposiform 
      haemangioendothelioma patients. However, there is considerable pharmacokinetic 
      variability among individuals, and it is difficult to develop an initial dosing 
      regimen. The goal of the present study is to recommend an initial sirolimus dose 
      in paediatric kaposiform haemangioendothelioma patients based on population 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics. METHODS: This was a retrospective clinical 
      study. A population pharmacokinetics model was established and population 
      characteristics, laboratory test results, drug combinations, and pharmacogenomics 
      were considered as potential covariates. The Monte Carlo method was used to 
      simulate the optimal initial dosage. RESULTS: The final covariates that affect 
      sirolimus clearance include weight and the CYP3A5 genotype. The initial dosage of 
      sirolimus for individuals with CYP3A5*3/*3 was 0.20 mg/kg split into two doses 
      for 5 to 60 kg body weight. For individuals with CYP3A5*1, the initial dose was 
      0.23 mg/kg split into two doses for 5 to 30 kg body weight and 0.20 mg/kg split 
      into two doses for 30 to 60 kg body weight. CONCLUSION: The recommendation for 
      the initial sirolimus dose in paediatric kaposiform haemangioendothelioma 
      patients was based on population pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics. This 
      study may provide practical value for sirolimus clinical use in paediatric 
      kaposiform haemangioendothelioma patients.

AB  - This study describes the maturation of sirolimus clearance in a cohort of very 
      young pediatric patients with vascular anomalies. The relationship between 
      allometrically scaled in vivo clearance and age was described by the Emax model 
      in patients aged 1 month to 2 years. Consistent with the observed increase, in 
      vitro intrinsic clearance of sirolimus using pediatric liver microsomes showed a 
      similar age-dependent increase. In children older than 2 years, allometrically 
      scaled sirolimus clearance did not show further maturation. Simulated clearance 
      estimates with a sirolimus physiologically based pharmacokinetic model that 
      included CYP3A4/5/7 and CYP2C8 maturation profiles were in close agreement with 
      observed in vivo clearance values. In addition, physiologically based 
      pharmacokinetic model-simulated sirolimus pharmacokinetic profiles predicted the 
      actual observations well. These results demonstrate the utility of a 
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling approach for the prediction of the 
      developmental trajectory of sirolimus metabolic activity and its effects on total 
      body clearance in neonates and infants.

TI  - A multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of everolimus versus azathioprine 
      and placebo to maintain steroid-induced remission in patients with 
      moderate-to-severe active Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2284-92
LID - 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2008.02024.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A prospective study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of 
      everolimus versus azathioprine or placebo in maintaining steroid-induced 
      remission in active Crohn's disease (CD) and assess the safety and 
      pharmacokinetics of everolimus. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study in adults with moderate-to-severe 
      active CD. The patients received oral steroids for a rapid induction of remission 
      plus everolimus 6 mg/day, azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg/day, or placebo as maintenance 
      treatment. The main outcome measure was the treatment success, defined as a 
      steroid-free remission by the end of month 3 and maintained until study cutoff 
      without the use of prohibited efficacy treatments. RESULTS: Following an interim 
      analysis, the study was terminated before enrollment was completed due to the 
      lack of efficacy. The full intent-to-treat population comprised 138 patients. 
      Only 96 patients who entered the study > or =7 months prior to data cutoff were 
      included in the primary efficacy population. The treatment success was achieved 
      in 13 of 38 everolimus patients, 22 of 36 azathioprine patients, and 8 of 22 
      placebo patients. Using the Kaplan-Meier estimates at month 7, the incidence of 
      treatment success was 22.0% with everolimus group (95% confidence interval [CI] 
      6.7-37.3%, P= 0.610 vs placebo), 38.3% with azathioprine group (95% CI 
      20.6-55.9%, P= 0.500 vs placebo), and 28.8% with placebo group (95% CI 
      7.7-49.9%). The type and incidence of adverse events in the everolimus cohort 
      were similar to those reported in the approved transplantation indications. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The safety and tolerability of everolimus (6 mg/day) in patients 
      with active CD were comparable to azathioprine. At this dose, everolimus is not 
      more efficacious in achieving a steroid-free remission in active CD than the 
      comparators.

TI  - Dose-Dependent Acute Effects of Everolimus Administration on Immunological, 
      Neuroendocrine and Psychological Parameters in Healthy Men.
PG  - 1251-1259

AB  - The rapamycin analogue everolimus (EVR) is a potent inhibitor of the mammalian 
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) and clinically used to prevent allograft rejections as 
      well as tumor growth. The pharmacokinetic and immunosuppressive efficacy of EVR 
      have been extensively reported in patient populations and in vitro studies. 
      However, dose-dependent ex vivo effects upon acute EVR administration in healthy 
      volunteers are rare. Moreover, immunosuppressive drugs are associated with 
      neuroendocrine changes and psychological disturbances. It is largely unknown so 
      far whether and to what extend EVR affects neuroendocrine functions, mood, and 
      anxiety in healthy individuals. Thus, in the present study, we analyzed the 
      effects of three different clinically applied EVR doses (1.5, 2.25, and 3 mg) 
      orally administered 4 times in a 12-hour cycle to healthy male volunteers on 
      immunological, neuroendocrine, and psychological parameters. We observed that 
      oral intake of medium (2.25 mg) and high doses (3 mg) of EVR efficiently 
      suppressed T cell proliferation as well as IL-10 cytokine production in ex vivo 
      mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell. Further, acute low (1.5 mg) 
      and medium (2.25 mg) EVR administration increased state anxiety levels 
      accompanied by significantly elevated noradrenaline (NA) concentrations. In 
      contrast, high-dose EVR significantly reduced plasma and saliva cortisol as well 
      as NA levels and perceived state anxiety. Hence, these data confirm the acute 
      immunosuppressive effects of the mTOR inhibitor EVR and provide evidence for 
      EVR-induced alterations in neuroendocrine parameters and behavior under 
      physiological conditions in healthy volunteers.

TI  - Sorafenib and everolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors and KRAS-mutated 
      NSCLC: A phase I trial with early pharmacodynamic FDG-PET assessment.
PG  - 4991-5007
LID - 10.1002/cam4.3131 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of patients with solid tumors and KRAS mutations remains 
      disappointing. One option is the combined inhibition of pathways involved in 
      RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR. METHODS: Patients with relapsed solid tumors were 
      treated with escalating doses of everolimus (E) 2.5-10.0 mg/d in a 14-day run-in 
      phase followed by combination therapy with sorafenib (S) 800 mg/d from day 15. 
      KRAS mutational status was assessed retrospectively in the escalation phase. 
      Extension phase included KRAS-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) only. 
      Pharmacokinetic analyses were accompanied by pharmacodynamics assessment of E by 
      FDG-PET. Efficacy was assessed by CT scans every 6 weeks of combination. RESULTS: 
      Of 31 evaluable patients, 15 had KRAS mutation, 4 patients were negative for KRAS 
      mutation, and the KRAS status remained unknown in 12 patients. Dose-limiting 
      toxicity (DLT) was not reached. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as 
      7.5 mg/d E + 800 mg/d S due to toxicities at previous dose level (10 mg/d 
      E + 800 mg/d S) including leucopenia/thrombopenia III° and pneumonia III° 
      occurring after the DLT interval. The metabolic response rate in FDG-PET was 17% 
      on day 5 and 20% on day 14. No patient reached partial response in CT scan. 
      Median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.25 and 
      5.85 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of patients with relapsed solid 
      tumors with 7.5 mg/d E and 800 mg/d S is safe and feasible. Early metabolic 
      response in FDG-PET was not confirmed in CT scan several weeks later. The 
      combination of S and E is obviously not sufficient to induce durable responses in 
      patients with KRAS-mutant solid tumors.

TI  - Phase I study of temsirolimus in combination with EKB-569 in patients with 
      advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 1934-41
LID - 10.1007/s10637-011-9742-1 [doi]
AB  - Purpose Activation of EGFR can stimulate proliferative and survival signaling 
      through mTOR. Preclinical data demonstrates synergistic activity of combined EGFR 
      and mTOR inhibition. We undertook a phase I trial of temsirolimus (T, an mTOR 
      inhibitor) and EKB-569 (E, an EGFR inhibitor) to determine the safety and 
      tolerability. Methods The primary aim was to determine the maximally tolerated 
      dose (MTD) of this combination in adults with solid tumors. Following the 
      dose-escalation phase, (Cohort A), two subsequent cohorts were used to assess any 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between the agents. Results Forty eight patients 
      were enrolled. The MTD of this combination was E, 35 mg daily and T, 30 mg on 
      days 1-3 and 15-17 using a 28-day cycle. The most common toxicities were nausea, 
      diarrhea, fatigue, anorexia, stomatitis, rash, anemia, neutropenia, 
      thrombocytopenia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Sixteen patients (36%) had at least 
      one grade 3 toxicity. The most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities were diarrhea, 
      dehydration, and nausea and vomiting (19% each). No grade 5 events were seen. 
      Four patients had a partial response and 15 had stable disease. Clinical benefit 
      was seen across a range of tumor types and in all cohorts. PK analysis revealed 
      no significant interaction between E and T. Conclusions This combination of 
      agents is associated with tolerable toxicities at doses that induced responses. 
      PK studies revealed no interaction between the drugs. Further investigations of 
      this targeting strategy may be attractive in renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell 
      lung cancer, alveolar sarcoma, and carcinoid tumor.

TI  - Developmental pharmacokinetics of sirolimus: Implications for precision dosing in 
      neonates and infants with complicated vascular anomalies.
LID - 10.1002/pbc.26470 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sirolimus has recently been shown to be efficacious and tolerable in 
      pediatric patients with complicated vascular anomalies. Nevertheless, dosing 
      information remains very limited especially for neonates and infants. The purpose 
      of this study was to develop an age-appropriate sirolimus starting dosing regimen 
      based on the developmental changes in drug elimination capacity using data 
      collected in neonates and infants. PROCEDURE: A recently developed sirolimus 
      maturation model [Emoto et al. CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol, 2016] was used 
      to simulate clearance estimates using realistic age and weight covariates for age 
      cohorts aged 0-24 months. Next, predose concentrations at steady state were 
      generated for each age cohort of neonates and infants. Dose requirements to 
      attain predefined target trough concentration ranges (10-15 and 5-10 ng/ml) were 
      simulated across the different age groups. Starting doses were chosen to maximize 
      the likelihood of achieving sirolimus-targeted concentrations. RESULTS: The 
      trajectory of simulated sirolimus clearances increased with age and was in 
      agreement with the previous findings in the Phase 2 study. The proposed dosing 
      regimens covered eight age cohorts and resulted in target attainment of more than 
      75-95% across selected regimens. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 
      age-appropriate sirolimus dosing regimens for neonates and infants. The algorithm 
      in combination with therapeutic drug management will facilitate sirolimus 
      precision dosing in young children with vascular anomalies. A prospective 
      evaluation is being planned.

TI  - Zotarolimus, a novel sirolimus analogue with potent anti-proliferative activity 
      on coronary smooth muscle cells and reduced potential for systemic 
      immunosuppression.
PG  - 228-35
AB  - Sirolimus (rapamycin) is an immunosuppressant used in preventing allograft 
      rejection and in drug-eluting stents to prevent restenosis after angioplasty. 
      Zotarolimus, an analogue of sirolimus, was designed to have a shorter in vivo 
      half-life. Zotarolimus was found to be mechanistically similar to sirolimus in 
      having high-affinity binding to the immunophilin FKBP12 and comparable potency 
      for inhibiting in vitro proliferation of both human and rat T cells. Rat 
      pharmacokinetic studies with intravenous dosing demonstrated terminal elimination 
      half-lives of 9.4 hours and 14.0 hours for zotarolimus and sirolimus, 
      respectively. Given orally, T1/2 values were 7.9 hours and 33.4 hours, 
      respectively. Consistent with its shorter duration, zotarolimus showed a 
      corresponding and statistically significant 4-fold reduction in potency for 
      systemic immunosuppression in 3 rat disease models. Pharmacokinetic studies in 
      cynomolgus monkey underpredicted the half-life difference between zotarolimus and 
      sirolimus apparent from recent clinical data. In vitro inhibition of human 
      coronary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation by zotarolimus was comparable to 
      sirolimus. Drug-eluting stents for local delivery of zotarolimus to the vessel 
      wall of coronary arteries are in clinical development. The pharmacological 
      profile of zotarolimus suggests it may be advantageous for preventing restenosis 
      with a reduced potential for causing systemic immunosuppression or other side 
      effects.

TI  - Safety and pharmacokinetics of sirolimus-eluting stents in the canine cerebral 
      vasculature: 180 day assessment.
PG  - 925-33; discussion 933-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated local and systemic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
      of sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) in canine cerebral vessels. METHODS: SES (1.5 x 
      8 mm, 79 microg/479 microg sirolimus) and control stents (1.5 x 8 mm stainless 
      steel with or without polymer) were implanted in canine basilar and ventral 
      spinal arteries. Animals were sacrificed for local pharmacokinetic (36 animals at 
      1, 3, 8, 30, 90, 180 days) and pharmacodynamic (60 animals at 3, 30, 90, 180 
      days) assessment. RESULTS: Postrecovery adverse clinical events were not serious, 
      requiring no unscheduled treatment. Histologically, brain and spinal cord 
      sections revealed scattered microinfarcts and minimal gliosis consistent with 
      postprocedure changes in all four stent-treatment groups. All stented vessels at 
      all time points demonstrated good luminal patency with low injury and 
      inflammation scores and no thrombosis of either stented or branch arteries. 
      Endothelialization was complete in all stent groups by 30 days. Intimal smooth 
      muscle cell scores were reduced in both SES groups at 30, 90, and 180 days. 
      Systemic sirolimus levels peaked between 1 and 7 hours postimplant (maximum 
      concentration, 1.2 +/- 1.47, 79 microg; 4.5 +/- 1.23 ng/ml, 479 microg), then 
      declined rapidly to 1 ng/ml or less by 96 hours. Peak local tissue sirolimus 
      levels were 41.5 ng/mg (79 microg) and 65 ng/mg (479 microg). CONCLUSION: SES in 
      canine cerebral vessels were associated with good luminal patency to 180 days, 
      with complete endothelialization and no evidence of acute thrombosis. This model 
      has shown that SES deployed within the brain do not cause neurotoxicity during a 
      180-day time course, even when exaggerated doses are used. The findings support 
      the contention that SES are safe to use and maintain patency in cerebral vessels.

AB  - The oral bioavailability of Sirolimus is limited by poor dissolution of the 
      compound in the gastrointestinal tract resulting in a low bioavailability and 
      large inter-individual differences in blood levels. Several different formulation 
      approaches were applied to overcome these disadvantageous pharmacokinetic 
      properties including the marketed oral solution and a tablet form containing wet 
      milled nanocrystals. These approaches deliver improved pharmacokinetics, yet, 
      they share the characteristics of complex production method and composition. We 
      have developed a nanostructured Sirolimus formulation prepared by the controlled 
      continuous flow precipitation of the compound from its solution in the presence 
      of stabilizers. We have shown that contrary to the batch production the process 
      could be easily intensified and scaled up; apparently the uniformity of the 
      precipitation is heavily dependent on the production parameters, most likely the 
      mixing of the solvent and antisolvent. We compared the physicochemical and 
      pharmacokinetic properties of the nanostructured formula with the marketed 
      nanoformula. We found that our method produces particles in the size range of 
      less than 100nm. The solid form redispersed instantaneously in water and in 
      biorelevant media. Both the solid form and the redispersed colloid solution 
      showed excellent stability even in accelerated test conditions. The oral 
      administration of the nanostructured formula resulted in faster absorption, 
      higher exposure and higher trough concentrations when compared to the marked 
      form. These advantageous properties could allow the development of solid oral 
      Sirolimus formulae with lower strength and gel based topical delivery systems.

TI  - Identifying optimal biologic doses of everolimus (RAD001) in patients with cancer 
      based on the modeling of preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic data.
PG  - 1596-602
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2007.14.1127 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To use preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic 
      (PD) modeling to predict optimal clinical regimens of everolimus, a novel oral 
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, to carry forward to expanded 
      phase I with tumor biopsy studies in cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Inhibition of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a molecular marker of mTOR signaling, was 
      selected for PD analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a phase 
      I clinical trial. PK and PD were measured up to 11 days after the fourth weekly 
      dose. A PK/PD model was used to describe the relationship between everolimus 
      concentrations and S6K1 inhibition in PBMCs of cancer patients and in PBMCs and 
      tumors of everolimus-treated CA20948 pancreatic tumor-bearing rats. RESULTS: 
      Time- and dose-dependent S6K1 inhibition was demonstrated in human PBMCs. In the 
      rat model, a relationship was shown between S6K1 inhibition in tumors or PBMCs 
      and antitumor effect. This allowed development of a direct-link PK/PD model that 
      predicted PBMC S6K1 inhibition-time profiles in patients. Comparison of rat and 
      human profiles simulated by the model suggested that a weekly 20- to 30-mg dose 
      of everolimus would be associated with an antitumor effect in an 
      everolimus-sensitive tumor and that daily administration would exert a greater 
      effect than weekly administration at higher doses. CONCLUSION: A direct-link 
      PK/PD model predicting the time course of S6K1 inhibition during weekly and daily 
      everolimus administration allowed extrapolation from preclinical studies and 
      first clinical results to select optimal doses and regimens of everolimus to 
      explore in future clinical trials.

TI  - Exploring Sirolimus Pharmacokinetic Variability Using Data Available from the 
      Routine Clinical Care of Renal Transplant Patients - Population Pharmacokinetic 
      Approach.
PG  - 323-331
LID - 10.2478/jomb-2018-0030 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to wide intra- and inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability 
      and narrow therapeutic index of sirolimus, the therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) 
      of sirolimus with detailed biochemical and clinical monitoring is necessary for 
      dose individualization in kidney transplant patients. The purpose of the study 
      was to explore and identify factors that contribute to pharmacokinetic 
      variability by developing and validating a population model using routine TDM 
      data and routinely monitored biochemical and clinical parameters. METHODS: The 
      data obtained by routine monitoring of 38 patients over a period of one year from 
      the sirolimus treatment initiation, were collected from patients' records. 
      Population analysis was performed using the software NONMEM(®). The validity of 
      the model was tested by the internal and external validation techniques. RESULTS: 
      The pharmacokinetic variability was partially explained with patient's age and 
      liver function. CL/F was found to decrease with age. According to the developed 
      model, sirolimus CL/F decreases by, in average, 37% in patients with aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST) greater than 37 IU/L. The internal and external validation 
      confirmed the satisfactory prediction of the developed model. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      population modeling of routinely monitored data allowed quantification of the age 
      and liver function influence on sirolimus CL/F. According to the final model, 
      patients with compromised liver function expressed via AST values require careful 
      monitoring and dosing adjustments. Proven good predictive performance makes this 
      model a useful tool in everyday clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimization of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) from the 1st week after 
      kidney transplantation (KT) may reduce the risk of CNI nephrotoxicity. METHODS: 
      Ten de novo KT recipients who received full exposure cyclosporine (CsA) and 
      prednisolone as initial therapy were enrolled. Initial CsA minimization was 50% 
      and started at day 7 after KT. This was synchronized with everolimus (EVL) 
      initiation. Target trough level of EVL was 3-8 ng/mL. Pharmacokinetics studies of 
      CsA and EVL were studied at week 4. The CsA dosage was further reduced to keep a 
      lowest value of serum creatinine and a target EVL level. Primary outcomes were 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline and last follow-up. 
      RESULTS: Patients' mean age at last follow-up was 60.6 ± 11.7 years. Follow-up 
      duration was 121.6 ± 12.8 months. Pharmacokinetics study found that Cmax of CsA 
      ranged from 309 to 1,896 ng/mL, mean area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUC) of CsA was 3,449 ± 1,402 ng·h/mL, C0 of EVL was 5.2 ± 
      1.5 ng/mL, Cmax of EVL was 15.4 ± 4.6 ng/mL, and AUC of EVL was 99.7 ± 26.1 
      ng·h/mL. Achieved nadir serum creatinine was 1.03 ± 0.33 mg/dL. Achieved best 
      eGFR (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) was 99.7 ± 26 mL/min. eGFR 
      at 12 months was 82 ± 25 mL/min. Last serum creatinine was 1.32 ± 0.45 mg/dL. 
      Last eGFR was 57.2 ± 13.55 mL/min. Actuarial death-censored 10-year graft 
      survival was 100%. Actuarial 10-year patient survival was 80%. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      intervention can lead to an average of 75% CsA minimization and a very good eGFR 
      at 10 years.

TI  - Proton pump inhibitor co-medication reduces active drug exposure in heart 
      transplant recipients receiving mycophenolate mofetil.
PG  - 4243-6
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2010.09.047 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are often prescribed for 
      gastrointestinal discomfort after heart transplantation. This study investigated 
      the impact of PPI use on mycophenolic acid (MPA) pharmacokinetics in heart 
      transplant recipients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in combination with a 
      calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus [TAC]/cyclosporine [CsA]) or mammalian target 
      of rapamycin inhibitor (sirolimus/everolimus). METHODS: Abbreviated MPA areas 
      under the curve (AUCs; 0, 30, and 120 minutes after morning intake) were obtained 
      in 19 patients on a PPI (initial examination) and 1 month after PPI 
      discontinuation (follow-up). Mean patient age was 58.2 ± 8.8 years, and mean time 
      after transplantation was 2.3 ± 4.0 years (range, 0.2-13.0 years). RESULTS: At 
      initial examination mean daily MMF dose was 2.2 ± 0.8 g. MMF dose was kept 
      unchanged for the duration of study (P = ns). Mean predose (C0) MPA serum 
      concentrations were insignificantly lower with PPI comedication (2.5 ± 2.2 mg/L 
      vs 2.8 ± 1.7 mg/L; P = .15). Dose-adjusted abbreviated MPA AUCs (adjusted to 
      morning dose) were significantly lower during PPI therapy (45.2 ± 20.3 vs 65.2 ± 
      38.8 mg·h/L·g [MMF]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PPI comedication during 
      MMF therapy show significantly lower exposure to mycophenolic acid determined by 
      dose-adjusted abbreviated MPA AUCs. Although the clinical relevance of this 
      pharmacokinetic interaction was not determined in this study, MPA drug monitoring 
      by limited sampling strategies might be helpful during changes in antacid 
      comedication in patients on MMF.

TI  - Phase II trial of temsirolimus in children with high-grade glioma, neuroblastoma 
      and rhabdomyosarcoma.

AB  - PURPOSE: A phase II study of temsirolimus was conducted in children and 
      adolescents with high-grade glioma, neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: Temsirolimus 75 mg/m(2) was administered once weekly until disease 
      progression or intolerance. Using the Simon 2-stage design, further enrolment in 
      each disease cohort required ≥ 2 objective responses within the first 12 weeks 
      for the first 12 evaluable patients (those who received ≥ 3 temsirolimus doses). 
      RESULTS: Fifty-two heavily pretreated patients with relapsed (12%) or refractory 
      (88%) disease, median age 8 years (range 1-21 years), were enroled and treated. 
      One patient with neuroblastoma achieved confirmed partial response within the 
      first 12 weeks; thus, none of the 3 cohorts met the criterion for continued 
      enrolment. Disease stabilisation at week 12 was observed in 7 of 17 patients 
      (41%) with high-grade glioma (5 diffuse pontine gliomas, 1 glioblastoma 
      multiforme and 1 anaplastic astrocytoma), 6 of 19 (32%) with neuroblastoma and 1 
      of 16 (6%) with rhabdomyosarcoma (partial response confirmed at week 18). In the 
      three cohorts, median duration of stable disease or better was 128, 663 and 75 d, 
      respectively. The most common treatment-related adverse events were 
      thrombocytopaenia, hyperlipidaemia and aesthenia. Pharmacokinetic findings were 
      similar to those observed in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Temsirolimus administered 
      weekly at the dose of 75 mg/m(2) did not meet the primary objective efficacy 
      threshold in children with high-grade glioma, neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma; 
      however, meaningful prolonged stable disease merits further evaluation in 
      combination therapy.

TI  - Rapamycin: distribution, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic range investigations.
PG  - 666-71
AB  - Rapamycin (RAPA) is a potent immunosuppressive drug that is presently undergoing 
      clinical trials. The most of the drug is sequestered in erythrocytes resulting in 
      whole blood concentrations being considerably higher than plasma concentrations. 
      The drug is metabolized by the same P450 3A enzyme that is involved in the 
      metabolism of cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Structural elucidation of RAPA 
      metabolites is required. The drug has a relatively long half-life in both humans 
      and animals with 24-h trough concentrations being within the analytic range of 
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) when immunosuppressive doses are 
      administered. For RAPA, a proportionality is exhibited between trough 
      concentrations and dose. In animal transplant models, trough concentrations of 
      the drug appear to be related to immunosuppressive efficacy and drug-related side 
      effects. The studies described here should provide the basis for establishment of 
      therapeutic monitoring protocols for the drug.

TI  - A phase I study of perifosine with temsirolimus for recurrent pediatric solid 
      tumors.
LID - 10.1002/pbc.26409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is aberrantly activated in many pediatric 
      solid tumors including gliomas and medulloblastomas. Preclinical data in a 
      pediatric glioma model demonstrated that the combination of perifosine (AKT 
      inhibitor) and temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitor) is more potent at inhibiting the 
      axis than either agent alone. We conducted this study to assess pharmacokinetics 
      and identify the maximum tolerated dose for the combination. PROCEDURE: We 
      performed a standard 3+3 phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study in patients 
      with recurrent/refractory pediatric solid tumors. Four dose levels of perifosine 
      (25-75 mg/m(2) /day) and temsirolimus (25-75 mg/m(2) IV weekly) were 
      investigated. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (median age 8.5 years) with brain 
      tumors (diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma [DIPG] n = 8, high-grade glioma n = 6, 
      medulloblastoma n = 2, ependymoma n = 1), neuroblastoma (n = 4), or 
      rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 2) were treated. The combination was generally well 
      tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicity was encountered. The most common grade 3 
      or 4 toxicities (at least possibly related) were thrombocytopenia (38.1%), 
      neutropenia (23.8%), lymphopenia (23.8%), and hypercholesterolemia (19.0%). 
      Pharmacokinetic findings for temsirolimus were similar to those observed in the 
      temsirolimus single-agent phase II pediatric study and pharmacokinetic findings 
      for perifosine were similar to those in adults. Stable disease was seen in 9 of 
      11 subjects with DIPG or high-grade glioma; no partial or complete responses were 
      achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of these AKT and mTOR inhibitors was safe 
      and feasible in patients with recurrent/refractory pediatric solid tumors.

TI  - Cyclosporin A, tacrolimus and sirolimus are potent inhibitors of the human breast 
      cancer resistance protein (ABCG2) and reverse resistance to mitoxantrone and 
      topotecan.
PG  - 374-83
AB  - PURPOSE: Several studies have demonstrated significant interactions between 
      immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporin A) and chemotherapeutic drugs that are BCRP 
      substrates (e.g., irinotecan), resulting in increased bioavailability and reduced 
      clearance of these agents. One possible mechanism underlying this observation is 
      that the immunosuppressants modulate the pharmacokinetics of these drugs by 
      inhibiting BCRP. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether the 
      immunosuppressants cyclosporin A, tacrolimus and sirolimus are inhibitors and/or 
      substrates of BCRP. METHODS: First, the effect of the immunosuppressants on BCRP 
      efflux activity in BCRP-expressing HEK cells was measured by flow cytometry. 
      RESULTS: Cyclosporin A, tacrolimus and sirolimus significantly inhibited 
      BCRP-mediated efflux of pheophorbide A, mitoxantrone and BODIPY-prazosin. The 
      EC(50) values of cyclosporin A, tacrolimus and sirolimus for inhibition of 
      BCRP-mediated pheophorbide A efflux were 4.3 +/- 1.9 microM, 3.6 +/- 1.8 microM 
      and 1.9 +/- 0.4 microM, respectively. Cyclosporin A, tacrolimus and sirolimus 
      also effectively reversed resistance of HEK cells to topotecan and mitoxantrone 
      conferred by BCRP. When direct efflux of cyclosporin A, tacrolimus and sirolimus 
      was measured, these compounds were found not to be transported by BCRP. 
      Consistent with this finding, BCRP did not confer resistance to the 
      immunosuppressants in HEK cells. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that 
      cyclosporin A, tacrolimus and sirolimus are effective inhibitors but not 
      substrates of BCRP. These findings could explain the altered pharmacokinetics of 
      BCRP substrate drugs when co-administered with the immunosuppressants and suggest 
      that pharmacokinetic modulation by the immunosuppressants may improve the 
      therapeutic outcome of these drugs.

PG  - 1899-912
LID - 10.1007/s11095-016-1926-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) inhibits host defense mechanisms, 
      including autophagy. We investigated particles containing rapamycin (RAP) alone 
      or in combination with isoniazid (INH) and rifabutin (RFB) for: targeting lung 
      macrophages on inhalation; inducing autophagy; and killing macrophage-resident 
      Mtb and/or augmenting anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs. METHODS: PLGA and drugs were 
      spray-dried. Pharmacokinetics, partial biodistribution (LC-MS/MS) and efficacy 
      (colony forming units, qPCR, acid fast staining, histopathology) in mice 
      following dry powder inhalation were evaluated. RESULTS: Aerodynamic diameters of 
      formulations were 0.7-4.7 μm. Inhaled particles reached deep lungs and were 
      phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, yielding AUC0-48 of 102 compared to 
      0.1 μg/ml × h obtained with equivalent intravenous dose. RAP particles induced 
      more autophagy in Mtb-infected macrophages than solutions. Inhaled particles 
      containing RAP alone in daily, alternate-day and weekly dosing regimens reduced 
      bacterial burden in lungs and spleens, inducing autophagy and phagosome-lysosome 
      fusion. Inhalation of particles containing RAP with INH and RFB cleared the lungs 
      and spleens of culturable bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting a potent 
      autophagy-inducing agent to airway and lung macrophages alone is feasible, but 
      not sufficient to eliminate Mtb. Combination of macrophage-targeted inhaled RAP 
      with classical anti-TB drugs contributes to restoring tissue architecture and 
      killing Mtb.

TI  - A Bayesian approach for population pharmacokinetic modelling of sirolimus.
PG  - 420-34
AB  - AIMS: To explore a Bayesian approach for the pharmacokinetic analysis of 
      sirolimus concentration data arising from therapeutic drug monitoring (poorly 
      informative concentration-time point design), and to explore possible covariate 
      relationships for sirolimus pharmacokinetics. METHODS: Sirolimus 
      concentration-time data were available as part of routine clinical care from 25 
      kidney transplant recipients. Most samples were taken at or near the trough time 
      point at steady state. The data were analyzed using a fully conditional Bayesian 
      approach with PKBUGS (v 1.1)/WinBUGS (v 1.3). Features of the data included 
      noncompliance and missing concentration measurements below the limit of 
      sensitivity of the assay. Informative priors were used. RESULTS: A 
      two-compartment model with proportional residual error provided the best fit to 
      the data (consisting of 315 sirolimus concentration-time points). The typical 
      value for the apparent clearance (CL/F ) was 12.5 l h(-1) at the median age of 44 
      years. Apparent CL was found to be inversely related to age with a posterior 
      probability of a clinically significant effect of 0.734. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      population pharmacokinetic model was developed for sirolimus using a novel 
      approach. Bayesian modelling with informative priors allowed interpretation of a 
      significant covariate relationship, even using poorly informative data.

TI  - Phase I trial of lenalidomide and CCI-779 in patients with relapsed multiple 
      myeloma: evidence for lenalidomide-CCI-779 interaction via P-glycoprotein.
PG  - 3427-34
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2010.32.4962 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma-cell neoplasm for which 
      most treatments involve a therapeutic agent combined with dexamethasone. The 
      preclinical combination of lenalidomide with the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 has 
      displayed synergy in vitro and represents a novel combination in MM. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: A phase I clinical trial was initiated for patients with relapsed 
      myeloma with administration of oral lenalidomide on days 1 to 21 and CCI-779 
      intravenously once per week during a 28-day cycle. Pharmacokinetic data for both 
      agents were obtained, and in vitro transport and uptake studies were conducted to 
      evaluate potential drug-drug interactions. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were 
      treated with 15 to 25 mg lenalidomide and 15 to 20 mg CCI-779. The 
      maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 25 mg lenalidomide with 15 mg 
      CCI-779. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated increased doses of CCI-779 resulted 
      in statistically significant changes in clearance, maximum concentrations, and 
      areas under the concentration-time curves, with constant doses of lenalidomide. 
      Similar and significant changes for CCI-779 pharmacokinetics were also observed 
      with increased lenalidomide doses. Detailed mechanistic interrogation of this 
      pharmacokinetic interaction demonstrated that lenalidomide was an ABCB1 
      (P-glycoprotein [P-gp]) substrate. CONCLUSION: The MTD of this combination 
      regimen was 25 mg lenalidomide with 15 mg CCI-779, with toxicities of fatigue, 
      neutropenia, and electrolyte wasting. Pharmacokinetic and clinical interactions 
      between lenalidomide and CCI-779 seemed to occur, with in vitro data indicating 
      lenalidomide was an ABCB1 (P-gp) substrate. To our knowledge, this is the first 
      report of a clinically significant P-gp-based drug-drug interaction with 
      lenalidomide.

AB  - Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using 20 pigs for 120-days implantation, 
      while one sirolimus-eluting stent was implanted into one of their coronary 
      artery. At different time points, the residual sirolimus on the stent, delivered 
      locally (to artery wall), regionally (to adjacent and downstream muscle) and 
      systemically (to plasma and visceral organs), was detected throughout 120 days. 
      Preclinical safety evaluation was performed using 32 pigs for 180-days 
      implantation to study the safety of metal platform material and the effectiveness 
      of sirolimus eluting coating on the HNS stent. The neointima area, restenosis 
      rate and inflammatory grade for HNS and control group stents were detected and 
      analyzed. Approximately 80% sirolimus was eluted from the sirolimus-eluting 
      stents after 30-days implantation in vivo. Additionally, there was sustained 
      sirolimus in the artery wall, cardiac muscle and heart throughout 120-days 
      implantation, and sirolimus accumulated to the peak at 90-days implantation. It 
      was inferred that the sirolimus eluting stent in this study was covered by 
      neointima before 90-days implantation, indicating that the sirolimus eluting 
      coating on the HNS stent was safe and effective. Very little sirolimus was 
      distributed in visceral organs after 14-days implantation. HNS sirolimus-eluting 
      stent exhibited lower restenosis rate and lower inflammatory grade than control 
      group, which verified that the sirolimus-eluting coating design in this study was 
      reasonable and practical. In addition, there were no significant difference in 
      restenosis rate and inflammatory score between HNS bare-metal stent and 
      drug-eluting stents, illustrating that HNS has good bio-compatibility and is 
      suitable to use as coronary artery stent material.

PG  - 607-13
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000314 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor that is being 
      used to prevent organ rejection in kidney transplant patients often in 
      combination with calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs; cyclosporine and tacrolimus). All 
      3 drugs are metabolized primarily by CYP3As. Clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) 
      studies of cyclosporine on sirolimus pharmacokinetics have been reported; 
      however, there are a few clinical DDI data related to tacrolimus. METHODS: In 
      vitro inhibition assay with sirolimus were conducted using recombinant CYP3As and 
      human microsomes in the presence and absence of CNIs. Sirolimus concentrations 
      were determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) assay. The DDI risk in terms of increase in sirolimus 
      area under the curve (AUC) was evaluated by a mechanistic model using in vitro 
      inhibition data and published pharmacokinetic parameters of CNIs. RESULTS: Both 
      CNIs showed similar inhibitory effects on sirolimus metabolism in human liver and 
      intestinal microsomes. Cyclosporine predominantly inhibited CYP3A4 (half maximal 
      inhibitory concentration = 0.71 µM) rather than CYP3A5 (>5 µM), whereas 
      tacrolimus showed similar inhibition for CYP3A4 (0.29 µM) and CYP3A5 (0.41 µM). 
      The predicted increase in AUC of sirolimus during the coadministration of 
      cyclosporine was 3.9-fold, which was comparable to the observed clinical data 
      (3.3-fold) in healthy volunteers. Sirolimus AUC was estimated to a 2.8- to 
      3.2-fold increase during the coadministration of tacrolimus, based on the 
      reported Cmax values and doses of tacrolimus in kidney transplant patients. In 
      addition, exploratory sensitivity analysis indicated that the predicted increase 
      in sirolimus AUC was sensitive to the free fraction of cyclosporine but not to 
      the free fraction of tacrolimus. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that tacrolimus 
      has a lower clinical DDI risk potential affecting sirolimus pharmacokinetics 
      compared with cyclosporine in kidney transplant patients.

TI  - Everolimus in pulmonary transplantation: pharmacokinetics and exposure-response 
      relationships.
PG  - 440-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study we evaluated exposure, safety and efficacy data from an 
      international trial of everolimus. We sought to identify a tolerated and 
      efficacious range for blood levels of this agent in maintenance lung transplant 
      recipients. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial, 213 
      maintenance lung transplant recipients received either everolimus 1.5 mg twice 
      daily (n = 101) or azathioprine 1 to 3 mg/kg/day (n = 112) with cyclosporine and 
      corticosteroids. At 15 visits over the first 2 years of the trial, we obtained 
      826 everolimus trough (C0) blood samples. We used median-effect analysis to 
      assess relationships between everolimus C0 vs efficacy and safety responses. 
      RESULTS: Everolimus administration began at 1.5 mg twice daily and was 
      progressively lowered over the first 2 months to an average of 1.2 +/- 0.4 mg 
      twice daily, which was maintained thereafter. This dose yielded median C0 levels 
      of 6.6 ng/ml (10th to 90th percentiles: 2.8 to 11.8 ng/ml). Over this range of 
      everolimus C0, freedom from a decline in pulmonary function with bronchiolitis 
      obliterans syndrome and freedom from biopsy-proven acute rejection were both > or 
      = 88%. The incidence of increased cholesterol (> 6.5 mmol/liter), increased 
      triglycerides (> 2.9 mmol/liter) and transiently decreased platelet count (< 100 
      x 10(9)/liter) rose significantly with increasing C0. Infections and drug-related 
      adverse events were not significantly related to exposure. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      tolerated and efficacious concentration range for everolimus in maintenance lung 
      transplantation appears to be 3 to 12 ng/ml when used in conjunction with 
      cyclosporine and corticosteroids. This range should be prospectively assessed 
      with possible refinement as more clinical experience is gained.

TI  - Development of a Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Model for Sirolimus: 
      Predicting Bioavailability Based on Intestinal CYP3A Content.
PG  - e59
LID - 10.1038/psp.2013.33 [doi]
AB  - Sirolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and is 
      increasingly being used in transplantation and cancer therapies. Sirolimus has 
      low oral bioavailability and exhibits large pharmacokinetic variability. The 
      underlying mechanisms for this variability have not been explored to a large 
      extent. Sirolimus metabolism was characterized by in vitro intrinsic clearance 
      estimation. Pathway contribution ranked from CYP3A4 > CYP3A5 > CYP2C8. With the 
      well stirred and Qgut models sirolimus bioavailability was predicted at 15%. 
      Interindividual differences in bioavailability could be attributed to variable 
      intestinal CYP3A expression. The physiologically-based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) 
      model developed in Simcyp predicted a high distribution of sirolimus into adipose 
      tissue and another elimination pathway in addition to CYP-mediated metabolism. 
      PBPK model predictive performance was acceptable with Cmax and area under the 
      curve (AUC) estimates within 20% of observed data in a dose escalation study. The 
      model also showed potential to assess the impact of hepatic impairment and 
      drug-drug interaction (DDI) on sirolimus pharmacokinetics.CPT: Pharmacometrics &

AB  - Effective regulation of transgene product in anatomically circumscribed brain 
      tissue is dependent on the pharmacokinetics of the regulating agent, the kinetics 
      of transcriptional activation and degradation of the transgene product. We 
      evaluated rapamycin-regulated AAV2-GDNF expression in the rat brain (striatum). 
      Regulated (a dual-component system: AAV2-FBZhGDNF + AAV2-TF1Nc) and constitutive 
      (CMV-driven) expression vectors were compared. Constitutively active AAV2-GDNF 
      directed stable GDNF expression in a dose-dependent manner and it increased for 
      the first month, thereafter reaching a plateau that was maintained over a further 
      3 months. For the AAV2-regGDNF, rapamycin was administered in a 3-days on/4-days 
      off cycle. Intraperitoneal, oral, and direct brain delivery (CED) of rapamycin 
      were evaluated. Two cycles of rapamycin at an intraperitoneal dose of 10 mg/kg 
      gave the highest GDNF level (2.75±0.01 ng/mg protein). Six cycles at 3 mg/kg 
      resulted in lower GDNF values (1.36±0.3 ng/mg protein). Interestingly, CED of 
      rapamycin into the brain at a very low dose (50 ng) induced GDNF levels 
      comparable to a 6-week intraperitoneal rapamycin cycle. This study demonstrates 
      the effectiveness of rapamycin regulation in the CNS. However, the kinetics of 
      the transgene in brain tissue, the regulator dosing amount and schedule are 
      critical parameters that influence the kinetics of accumulation and zenith of the 
      encoded transgene product.

AB  - The aim of this study was to improve the physicochemical properties and oral 
      absorption of poorly water-soluble everolimus via preparation of a solid 
      dispersion (SD) system using a solvent wetting (SW) technique. The 
      physicochemical properties, drug release profile, and bioavailability of SD 
      prepared by SW process were also compared to SD prepared by the conventional 
      co-precipitation method. Solid state characterizations using scanning electron 
      microscopy, particle size analysis and X-ray powder diffraction indicated that 
      drug homogeneously dispersed and existed in an amorphous state within the intact 
      polymeric carrier. Whereas, a film-like mass was obtained by a co-precipitation 
      method and further pulverization step was needed for tabletization. The drug 
      release from the SD tablet prepared by SW process at a ratio of drug to 
      hydroxypropyl methylcellulose of 1:15 was markedly higher than the drug alone and 
      equivalent to the marketed product (Afinitor(®), Novartis Pharmaceuticals), a SD 
      tablet prepared by co-precipitation method, archiving over 75% the drug release 
      after 30 min. At the accelerated (40°C/75% R.H.) and stress (80°C) stability 
      tests, the novel formula was more stable than drug powder and provided comparable 
      drug stability with the commercially available product, which contains a 
      potentially risky antioxidant, butylated hydroxyl toluene. The pharmacokinetic 
      parameters after single oral administration in beagles showed no significant 
      difference (P>0.01) between the novel SD-based tablet and the marketed product. 
      The results of this study, therefore, suggest that the novel SD system prepared 
      by the solvent wetting process may be a promising approach for improving the 
      physicochemical stability and oral absorption of the sirolimus derivatives.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interactions augment toxicities of sirolimus/cyclosporine 
      combinations.
PG  - 1059-1071
LID - 10.1681/ASN.V1251059 [doi]
AB  - This study correlated the dynamic effects of sirolimus (rapamycin; RAPA) and 
      cyclosporine (CsA) alone versus in combination to produce renal dysfunction, 
      myelosuppression, or hyperlipidemia, with their corresponding blood and tissue 
      concentrations. After salt-depleted rats were treated with RAPA (0.4 to 6.4 mg/kg 
      per d) and/or CsA (2.5 to 20.0 mg/kg per d) for 14 d, the GFR, lipid levels, bone 
      marrow cellularity, and CsA/RAPA concentrations in whole blood versus liver or 
      renal tissues were measured, and the median effect model was used to discern the 
      type of drug interactions. Compared with vehicle controls (1.98 +/- 0.34 ml/min), 
      GFR values were reduced only by large doses of drug monotherapy, namely RAPA (3.2 
      mg/kg per d = 1.2 +/- 0.02 ml/min or 6.4 mg/kg per d = 1.3 +/- 0.2 ml/min; both P 
      < 0.01) or CsA (10.0 mg/kg per d = 1.2 +/- 0.1 ml/min or 20.0 mg/kg per d = 0.8 
      +/- 0.4 ml/min; both P < 0.01). In contrast, hosts that were treated with smaller 
      doses of CsA/RAPA combinations showed more pronounced effects in reduction of GFR 
      values: 2.5/0.4 mg/kg per d, modestly (1.5 +/- 0.5 ml/min; P < 0.01); 5.0/0.8 
      mg/kg per d, moderately (0.23 +/- 0.01 ml/min; P < 0.001); and higher-dose 
      groups, markedly. The exacerbation of renal dysfunction seemed to be due to a 
      pharmacokinetic interaction of RAPA to greatly increase CsA concentrations in 
      whole blood and, particularly, in kidney tissue. In contrast, the pharmacodynamic 
      effects of CsA to potentiate two RAPA-mediated toxicities-myelosuppression and

TI  - The effect of multiple doses of rifampin and ketoconazole on the single-dose 
      pharmacokinetics of ridaforolimus.
PG  - 1247-53
LID - 10.1007/s00280-011-1819-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ridaforolimus is an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin 
      protein, with potent activity in vitro and in vivo. Ridaforolimus is primarily 
      cleared by metabolism via cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and is a P-glycoprotein 
      (P-gp) substrate. Since potential exists for ridaforolimus to be co-administered 
      with agents that affect CYP3A and P-gp activity, this healthy volunteer study was 
      conducted to assess the effect of rifampin or ketoconazole on ridaforolimus 
      pharmacokinetics. METHODS: Part 1: single-dose ridaforolimus 40 mg followed by 
      rifampin 600 mg daily for 21 days and singledose ridaforolimus 40 mg on day 14. 
      Part 2: single-dose ridaforolimus 5 mg followed by ketoconazole 400 mg daily for 
      14 days and single-dose ridaforolimus 2 mg on day 2. RESULTS: Part 1: the 
      geometric mean ratios (GMRs) (90% confidence interval [CI]) for ridaforolimus 
      area under the concentration-time curve to the last time point with a detectable 
      blood concentration (AUC₀-∞) and maximum blood concentration (Cmax) (rifampin + 
      ridaforolimus/ ridaforolimus) were 0.57 (0.41, 0.78) and 0.66 (0.49, 0.90), 
      respectively. Both time to Cmax (Tmax) and apparent halflife (t₁/₂) were similar. 
      Part 2: the GMRs (90% CI) based on dose-normalized AUC₀-∞ and Cmax (ketoconazole 
      + ridaforolimus/ridaforolimus alone) were 8.51 (6.97, 10.39) and 5.35 (4.40, 
      6.52), respectively. Ridaforolimus apparent t₁/₂ was *1.5-fold increased for 
      ketoconazole ? ridaforolimus; however, Tmax values were similar. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Rifampin and ketoconazole both have a clinically meaningful effect on the 
      pharmacokinetics of ridaforolimus.

TI  - Phase ib of sorafenib in combination with everolimus in patients with advanced 
      solid tumors, selected on the basis of molecular targets.
PG  - 344-5
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2013-0335 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular alterations of the PI3K and Ras pathways often occur in 
      human cancer. In this trial, the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and activity of two 
      drugs inhibiting these pathways-everolimus and sorafenib-were investigated. 
      METHODS: Thirteen patients with progressing solid tumors were treated with 
      everolimus and sorafenib, according to a 3+3 scheme. Patients were selected on 
      the basis of immunohistochemical expression of tumor molecular targets, including 
      phospho-AKT, -p70S6K, and -ERK1/2. RESULTS: The daily recommended dose identified 
      was 2.5 mg of everolimus and 600 mg of sorafenib. Dose-limiting toxicities 
      included grade 3 asthenia and hand-foot skin reaction. No grade 4 adverse events 
      were observed. The most frequent grade 3 toxicities were hypophosphatemia 
      (30.8%), alanine aminotransferase level increase, asthenia, and anorexia (14%). 
      No pharmacokinetic interactions were identified between everolimus and sorafenib. 
      Of 12 evaluable patients, we observed 2 partial responses, with greater than 10% 
      shrinkage in an additional 5 patients. Objective responses were observed in one 
      patient with a thymoma and in one patient with a lung adenocarcinoma. Tumor 
      shrinkage that did not qualify as a partial response was seen in an abdominal 
      leiomyosarcoma and in adenoid cystic carcinomas. CONCLUSION: The combination of 
      everolimus and sorafenib is safe. The tumor activity observed in different tumor 
      types could be the result of the combined action of these drugs as well as the 
      molecular selection of the treated population. Further research is warranted to 
      better investigate drugs simultaneously blocking the PI3K and the Ras pathways 
      and to refine patient selection.

TI  - Superiority of rapamycin over tacrolimus in preserving nonhuman primate Treg 
      half-life and phenotype after adoptive transfer.
PG  - 2691-703
LID - 10.1111/ajt.12934 [doi]
AB  - Many critical issues remain concerning how best to deploy adoptive regulatory T 
      cell (Treg) immunotherapy to the clinic. These include a determination of their 
      pharmacokinetic characteristics, their optimal dose, their phenotypic stability 
      and the best therapies with which to pair Tregs. By performing a CFSE-labeled 
      autologous Treg pulse experiment, we determined that the accessible peripheral 
      blood Treg pool in rhesus macaques is quite large (75 ± 11 × 10(6) Tregs/kg). 
      Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that Tregs have two phases of elimination: an α 
      phase, with a T1/2 in the peripheral blood of 32.4 ± 11.3 h and a β phase with a 
      T1/2 of 120.4 ± 19.7 h. In addition to their short initial half-life, Tregs 
      underwent rapid phenotypic shifts after infusion, with significant loss of both 
      CD25 and FoxP3 by day +6. While tacrolimus stabilized CD25 expression, it did not 
      improve T1/2 , nor mitigate the loss of FoxP3. In contrast, rapamycin 
      significantly stabilized both CD25 and FoxP3, and supported an increased 
      half-life, with an α phase of 67.7 ± 6.9 h and a β phase of 252.1 ± 54.9 h. These 
      results suggest that rapamycin may be a necessary addition to Treg immunotherapy, 
      and that tacrolimus may be deleterious to Treg integrity posttransfer.

      carcinoma.
PG  - 4194-200
LID - 10.1002/cncr.25931 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose 
      (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor effect of everolimus, 
      a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, in combination with sorafenib, a 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell 
      carcinoma. METHODS: Sequential cohorts of patients received escalating doses of 
      everolimus and sorafenib in 28-day cycles in the absence of a dose-limiting 
      toxicity (DLT) or disease progression were examined. RESULTS: Twenty patients 
      with a median age of 65 years received therapy in 3 cohorts. Dose level 1 was 
      comprised of everolimus at a dose of 2.5 mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 400 
      mg twice daily (6 patients), dose level 2 was comprised of everolimus at a dose 
      of 5 mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily (8 patients), and 
      dose level 3 was comprised of everolimus at a dose of 10 mg daily and sorafenib 
      at a dose of 200 mg twice daily (6 patients). DLTs included grade 4 (according to 
      National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 
      3.0]) hyperuricemia with grade 2 gout and grade 3 lipase associated with grade 2 
      pancreatitis at dose level 2, and grade 3 rash in 2 patients at dose level 3. 
      Dose level 2 (everolimus at a dose of 5 mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 400 
      mg twice daily) was established as the maximum tolerated dose. Treatment-related 
      adverse events occurring in >20% of patients included diarrhea, hand-foot 
      syndrome, hypertension, hypophosphatemia, hypothyroidism, and rash. Five of 20 
      patients achieved Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)-defined 
      partial responses, all of which occurred in patients without a history of prior 
      systemic therapy. Seven of 8 patients treated at dose level 2 experienced a 
      partial response or stable disease. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no 
      interaction between everolimus and sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of 
      everolimus and sorafenib was associated with acceptable toxicity and evidence of 
      antitumor activity in previously untreated patients with metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma.

TI  - Combined image guided monitoring the pharmacokinetics of rapamycin loaded human 
      serum albumin nanoparticles with a split luciferase reporter.
PG  - 3991-4000
LID - 10.1039/c5nr07308a [doi]
AB  - Imaging guided techniques have been increasingly employed to investigate the 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and biodistribution of nanoparticle based drug delivery 
      systems. In most cases, however, the PK profiles of drugs could vary 
      significantly from those of drug delivery carriers upon administration in the 
      blood circulation, which complicates the interpretation of image findings. Herein 
      we applied a genetically encoded luciferase reporter in conjunction with near 
      infrared (NIR) fluorophores to investigate the respective PK profiles of a drug 
      and its carrier in a biodegradable drug delivery system. In this system, a 
      prototype hydrophobic agent, rapamycin (Rapa), was encapsulated into human serum 
      albumin (HSA) to form HSA Rapa nanoparticles, which were then labeled with Cy5 
      fluorophore to facilitate the fluorescence imaging of HSA carrier. Meanwhile, we 
      employed transgenetic HN12 cells that were modified with a split luciferase 
      reporter, whose bioluminescence function is regulated by Rapa, to reflect the PK 
      profile of the encapsulated agent. It was interesting to discover that there 
      existed an obvious inconsistency of PK behaviors between HSA carrier and 
      rapamycin in vitro and in vivo through near infrared fluorescence imaging (NIFRI) 
      and bioluminescence imaging (BLI) after treatment with Cy5 labeled HSA Rapa. 
      Nevertheless, HSA Rapa nanoparticles manifested favorable in vivo PK and tumor 
      suppression efficacy in a follow-up therapeutic study. The developed strategy of 
      combining a molecular reporter and a fluorophore in this study could be extended 
      to other drug delivery systems to provide profound insights for non-invasive 
      real-time evaluation of PK profiles of drug-loaded nanoparticles in pre-clinical 
      studies.

TI  - Phase II study of temsirolimus (CCI-779), a novel inhibitor of mTOR, in heavily 
      pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
PG  - 5314-22
AB  - PURPOSE: In this study, two doses of temsirolimus (CCI-779), a novel inhibitor of 
      the mammalian target of rapamycin, were evaluated for efficacy, safety, and 
      pharmacokinetics in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
      who had been heavily pretreated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 109) were 
      randomly assigned to receive 75 or 250 mg of temsirolimus weekly as a 30-minute 
      intravenous infusion. Patients were evaluated for tumor response, time to tumor 
      progression, adverse events, and pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus. RESULTS: 
      Temsirolimus produced an objective response rate of 9.2% (10 partial responses) 
      in the intent-to-treat population. Median time to tumor progression was 12.0 
      weeks. Efficacy was similar for both dose levels but toxicity was more common 
      with the higher dose level, especially grade 3 or 4 depression (10% of patients 
      at the 250-mg dose level, 0% at the 75-mg dose level). The most common 
      temsirolimus-related adverse events of all grades were mucositis (70%), 
      maculopapular rash (51%), and nausea (43%). The most common, clinically important 
      grade 3 or 4 adverse events were mucositis (9%), leukopenia (7%), hyperglycemia 
      (7%), somnolence (6%), thrombocytopenia (5%), and depression (5%). CONCLUSION: In 
      heavily pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, 75 
      and 250 mg temsirolimus showed antitumor activity and 75 mg temsirolimus showed a 
      generally tolerable safety profile.

TI  - Low-dose sirolimus in combination with mycophenolate mofetil improves kidney 
      graft function late after renal transplantation and suggests pharmacokinetic 
      interaction of both immunosuppressive drugs.
PG  - 181-5
AB  - AIMS: Chronic allograft nephropathy and/or calcineurin inhibitor toxicity are 
      common problems after organ transplantation. The aim of this study was to examine 
      the safety and efficacy of switching from a calcineurin inhibitor-based to a 
      calcineurin inhibitor-free immunosuppressive regimen consisting of sirolimus and 
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) late after renal transplantation. METHODS: Kidney 
      biopsies were performed in renal-transplanted patients with increasing serum 
      creatinine levels at least 6 months after transplantation (mean time +/- SD after 
      renal transplantation: 76.4 +/- 50.4 months). Patients with no signs of acute 
      rejection were switched to MMF (500-2,000 mg/day) in combination with a low dose 
      of sirolimus (1 mg/day). Renal function, serum chemistry, blood trough levels of 
      sirolimus and MMF, and blood pressure were monitored. RESULTS: 13 patients were 
      investigated. During our observation period (mean observation time +/- SD: 11.2 
      +/- 5.9 months), an improvement in renal function was observed in 10/13 patients. 
      In 3/13 patients, renal function deteriorated further and hemodialysis was 
      initiated in 2 patients within the next 6 months. However, a serum creatinine 
      concentration above 3.5 mg/dl was measured in 2 of those 3 patients prior to the 
      switch of the immunosuppressive protocol. Administration of a low dosis of 
      sirolimus (1 mg/day) led to relevant sirolimus (4.16 +/- 1.85 ng/ml) and MMF 
      blood trough levels (month 1: 6.8 +/- 3.46; month 3: 4.67 +/- 1.78 mg/l). The 
      following adverse events were observed: borderline acute rejection (1/11 
      patients), anemia responding to higher dosage of erythropoietin (3/11), 
      hyperlipidemia (1/11), and urinary tract infections (4/11). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose 
      sirolimus therapy in combination with concentration-adjusted MMF therapy leads to 
      improvement of organ function late after renal transplantation. The follow-up of 
      those patients should include assessments of blood cell counts, serum lipids and 
      urinalysis to recognize the possible side effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need to monitor everolimus blood concentrations in renal 
      transplant recipients as a result of its high pharmacokinetic variability and 
      narrow therapeutic window. However, analytical methods to determine blood 
      concentrations often differ in performance. Therefore, we investigated whether 
      two commonly used therapeutic drug monitoring methods for everolimus were in 
      agreement and to what extent their differences could lead to differences in 
      dosage advice. DESIGN AND METHODS: Six hundred twelve whole blood samples were 
      obtained from 28 adult renal transplant recipients receiving everolimus and 
      prednisolone therapy. These samples included 286 everolimus trough 
      concentrations. The remaining samples were obtained up to 6 hours post everolimus 
      intake and allowed calculation of 84 AUCs0-12h. All samples were analyzed with 
      fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) on an Abbott TDxFLx analyzer and 
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: Everolimus 
      blood concentrations measured with FPIA and LC-MS/MS were not in agreement. 
      Concentrations determined by FPIA were, on average, 23% higher than 
      concentrations quantified by LC-MS/MS. Moreover, concentrations lower than 15 
      mug/L or AUC0-12h determined with FPIA could be twofold higher than with 
      LC-MS/MS. This variability can lead to clinically relevant differences in dose 
      adjustment of up to 1.25 mg everolimus despite using a correction factor of 23%. 
      Finally, when trough concentrations were measured with FPIA, higher intrapatient 
      variability was observed compared with the use of LC-MS/MS. CONCLUSION: LC-MS/MS 
      outperforms FPIA for clinical drug monitoring and intervention of everolimus 
      therapy in adult renal transplant recipients on dual therapy with prednisolone. 
      Specifically, the use of FPIA can lead to clinically relevant differences in 
      everolimus dosage advice and higher intrapatient variability.

      randomised, open-label, multicentre study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Combined mTORC1 inhibition with everolimus (EVE) and 
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit p110α blockade with alpelisib 
      (ALP) has demonstrated synergistic efficacy in preclinical models and supports 
      testing the combination of ALP and EVE in the clinical setting. The primary 
      objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended dose for 
      expansion (RDE) of ALP in combination with EVE and in combination with EVE and 
      exemestane (EXE) and subsequently assess safety, preliminary efficacy and effect 
      of ALP on the pharmacokinetics of EVE and determine the magnitude of the 
      drug-drug interaction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dose escalation phases were 
      conducted in patients with advanced solid tumours and in postmenopausal women 
      with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 
      2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC). The dose expansion phase was 
      conducted in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour and renal cell 
      carcinoma (RCC) (both mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitor [mTORi]-naive), 
      in patients with mTORi-pretreated solid tumours and in postmenopausal women with 
      HR+, HER2- ABC. RESULTS: During the doublet escalation phase, dose-limiting 
      toxicities (DLTs) were reported in 5 of 10 (50%) patients: one patient had grade 
      (Gr) 2 hyperglycemia and one patient had Gr 3 diarrhoea in the 300 mg dose group, 
      one patient had Gr 2 hyperglycemia and one patient had Gr 4 hypocalcaemia in the 
      250 mg dose group, and one patient in the 200 mg dose group had Gr 3 diarrhoea 
      and Gr 3 stomatitis. The combination of ALP 250 mg + EVE 2.5 mg was declared as 
      the MTD/RDE in subjects with advanced solid tumours. In the triplet escalation 
      phase, one patient who received ALP 200 mg + EVE 2.5 mg + EXE 25 mg had a DLT of 
      Gr 3 acute kidney injury. This dose combination was declared as the MTD and RDE 
      in subjects with advanced HR-positive HER2-negative BC. The common adverse events 
      (≥30% patients), occurring across all phases, were hyperglycaemia, stomatitis, 
      diarrhoea, nausea, asthenia, decreased appetite and fatigue. The 
      sixteen-week progression-free survival rate was 52.4% (90% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 32.8, 71.4) in the RCC cohort, 35.3% (90% CI: 16.6, 58.0) in the prior pNET 
      cohort and 30.0% (90% CI: 8.7, 60.7) in the prior mTORi cohort. The 
      pharmacokinetics of 2.5 mg of EVE was largely unchanged in the presence of ALP, 
      independent of the dose (250 mg or 300 mg). There were no clinically relevant 
      drug-drug interactions observed between ALP and EVE. CONCLUSION: The overall 
      safety profile of ALP with EVE and EXE is manageable and reversible; no 
      unexpected safety signals were noted compared with the individual safety 
      profiles. Pharmacokinetics of ALP, EVE and EXE was largely unchanged in 
      combination with each other.

      posaconazole.

AB  - Being a substrate of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme, sirolimus 
      metabolism is decreased when posaconazole is administered concomitantly. However, 
      because of the poor bioavailability of the oral suspension of posaconazole with 
      which low plasma concentrations are obtained, CYP3A4 inhibition is weak and a 
      50-75% dose reduction of sirolimus is sufficient to avoid sirolimus overdosage. 
      The new tablet formulation allows reaching posaconazole concentrations 3-4 fold 
      higher than those obtained with the oral suspension. Based on a case of sirolimus 
      overdosage following posaconazole tablets administration, we modelled the 
      inhibition of sirolimus clearance by posaconazole, and then simulated several 
      dosage regimens of sirolimus taken together with posaconazole tablets. We were 
      able to describe well the interaction, and found a value of IC50 of posaconazole 
      towards sirolimus clearance of 0.68 μg/mL. The simulations showed that even a 80% 
      decrease of the daily dose of sirolimus is unsuitable in many cases with trough 
      concentrations of posaconazole of 2 μg/mL. A decrease of 40% of the dose with 
      spacing administrations of 3 days may be considered. The clinicians and 
      pharmacologists must be warned that the use of posaconazole tablets may result in 
      an inhibition of CYP3A4 of greater magnitude than with the oral suspension.

TI  - Lenvatinib in combination with everolimus in patients with advanced or metastatic 
      renal cell carcinoma: A phase 1 study.
PG  - 922-928
LID - 10.1111/iju.13776 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics and antitumor 
      activities of lenvatinib, an oral inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine 
      kinases, in combination with everolimus, an inhibitor of mammalian target of 
      rapamycin, in Japanese patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma 
      after disease progression with vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted 
      therapy. METHODS: Lenvatinib 18 mg and everolimus 5 mg once daily were 
      administered on 28-day continuous cycles until disease progression or 
      unacceptable toxicity. Adverse events were evaluated according to the Common 
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03, and tumor response was 
      assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor version 
      1.1. Pharmacokinetics sampling was carried out during the first cycle. RESULTS: 
      Seven patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma received this combination 
      treatment. Dose-limiting toxicity was not observed. The most commonly observed 
      adverse events were thrombocytopenia and decreased appetite (100%), followed by 
      hypertriglyceridaemia and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (86%). The 
      most common grade 3 adverse event was lymphopenia (43%). No grade 4 or 5 adverse 
      events occurred. The steady-state mean areas under the concentration-time curves 
      of lenvatinib and everolimus were 3220 and 401 ng·h/mL, respectively. Five 
      patients (71%) had partial response, and one (14%) had stable disease. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Lenvatinib 18 mg and everolimus 5 mg once daily are well tolerated 
      and manageable, and their combined administration has no significant effect on 
      either drug's pharmacokinetics. Overall, this combination therapy shows 
      encouraging antitumor activity in Japanese patients with renal cell carcinoma.

TI  - Phase I study of everolimus plus weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab in patients 
      with metastatic breast cancer pretreated with trastuzumab.
PG  - 5110-5
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2009.27.8549 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the recommended dose of everolimus, a mammalian target of 
      rapamycin inhibitor, combined with paclitaxel and trastuzumab in patients with 
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing metastatic breast 
      cancer pretreated with trastuzumab. METHODS: In this phase Ib, multicenter, 
      dose-escalation study, patients were treated with everolimus 5 mg/d, 10 mg/d, or 
      30 mg/wk in combination with paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 
      weeks) and trastuzumab (2 mg/kg weekly). End points included end-of-cycle 1 
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate (primary end point), safety, relative dose 
      intensity of study drugs, overall response rate (ORR), and pharmacokinetics. 
      RESULTS: Of 33 patients enrolled, 31 were pretreated with taxanes, and 32 were 
      resistant to trastuzumab. Patients received a median of two lines of chemotherapy 
      in the metastatic setting (range, 0 to 17 lines). Three patients experienced 
      cycle 1 DLTs: febrile neutropenia (5 mg/d), stomatitis (10 mg/d), and confusion 
      (30 mg/wk). Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was the most common toxicity observed (n = 
      17 patients [52%]). On the basis of observed DLTs and overall safety, 10 mg/d was 
      recommended for additional development. Twenty-seven patients had measurable 
      disease and were evaluable for efficacy. Among these patients, ORR was 44%. 
      Overall disease was controlled for 6 months or more in 74%. Median 
      progression-free survival was 34 weeks (95% CI, 29.1 to 40.7 weeks). Among 11 
      patients who were resistant to both trastuzumab and taxane, a similar level of 
      antitumor activity was observed (ORR, 55%). CONCLUSION: Everolimus combined with 
      weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab was generally well tolerated and had 
      encouraging antitumor activity in patients with trastuzumab-pretreated and 
      -resistant metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.

TI  - Sirolimus oral absorption in rats is increased by ketoconazole but is not 
      affected by D-alpha-tocopheryl poly(ethylene glycol 1000) succinate.
PG  - 308-13
AB  - The contributions of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and P-glycoprotein to sirolimus 
      oral bioavailability in rats were evaluated by coadministration of sirolimus 
      (Rapamune) with the CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole or the P-glycoprotein inhibitor 
      D-alpha-tocopheryl poly(ethylene glycol 1000) succinate (TPGS). Groups of six 
      male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were administered Rapamune (1 mg/kg) by oral 
      gavage, alone and with ketoconazole (30 mg/kg) or TPGS (50 mg/kg). Sirolimus 
      levels were measured in whole blood over a 6-h time course. Sirolimus C(max) (6.6 
      +/- 1.6 versus 26 +/- 7 ng/ml) and area under the concentration versus time curve 
      from 0 to 6 h (AUC(0-6)) (22 +/- 7 versus 105 +/- 27 ng. h/ml) were increased 3- 
      to 5-fold by ketoconazole. Median T(max) (1.5-2 h) was unchanged. TPGS had no 
      effect on sirolimus absorption. The interaction of sirolimus with P-glycoprotein 
      was also evaluated in vitro using HCT-8 and Caco-2 cell monolayers. Consistent 
      with published reports, sirolimus was a good inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, 
      inhibiting polarized basolateral-to-apical flux of rhodamine 123 with an IC(50) 
      of 0.625 to 1.25 microM (cyclosporine caused >80% inhibition at 5 microM). 
      Sirolimus did not demonstrate significant polarized flux in either direction 
      using the same monolayers (basolateral-to-apical flux was <2 times the 
      apical-to-basolateral). Moreover, sirolimus flux was not impacted by 
      cyclosporine, suggesting that it does not undergo P-glycoprotein-mediated 
      transport in this system. The lack of significant sirolimus transport by 
      P-glycoprotein may, in part, explain the lack of a TPGS effect on sirolimus 
      absorption in rats.

TI  - Autophagy Inhibition to Augment mTOR Inhibition: a Phase I/II Trial of Everolimus 
      and Hydroxychloroquine in Patients with Previously Treated Renal Cell Carcinoma.
PG  - 2080-2087
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-2204 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Everolimus inhibits the mTOR, activating cytoprotective autophagy. 
      Hydroxychloroquine inhibits autophagy. On the basis of preclinical data 
      demonstrating synergistic cytotoxicity when mTOR inhibitors are combined with an 
      autophagy inhibitor, we launched a clinical trial of combined everolimus and 
      hydroxychloroquine, to determine its safety and activity in patients with 
      clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three centers 
      conducted a phase I/II trial of everolimus 10 mg daily and hydroxychloroquine in 
      patients with advanced ccRCC. The objectives were to determine the MTD of 
      hydroxychloroquine with daily everolimus, and to estimate the rate of 6-month 
      progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with ccRCC receiving 
      everolimus/hydroxychloroquine after 1-3 prior treatment regimens. Correlative 
      studies to identify patient subpopulations that achieved the most benefit 
      included population pharmacokinetics, measurement of autophagosomes by electron 
      microscopy, and next-generation tumor sequencing. RESULTS: No dose-limiting 
      toxicity was observed in the phase I trial. The recommended phase II dose of 
      hydroxychloroquine 600 mg twice daily with everolimus was identified. Disease 
      control [stable disease + partial response (PR)] occurred in 22 of 33 (67%) 
      evaluable patients. PR was observed in 2 of 33 patients (6%). PFS ≥ 6 months was 
      achieved in 15 of 33 (45%) of patients who achieved disease control. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Combined hydroxychloroquine 600 mg twice daily with 10 mg daily everolimus was 
      tolerable. The primary endpoint of >40% 6-month PFS rate was met. 
      Hydroxychloroquine is a tolerable autophagy inhibitor in future RCC or other 
      trials.

AB  - Everolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor approved for the 
      treatment of various tumor types. Less invasive measurement of everolimus 
      concentrations could facilitate pharmacokinetic studies and personalized dosing 
      based on whole blood concentrations, known as therapeutic drug monitoring. 
      Volumetric Absorptive Microsampling (VAMS) has been introduced as a patient 
      friendly, less invasive sampling technique to obtain an accurate volume of whole 
      blood regardless of hematocrit value. We describe the bioanalytical validation 
      and clinical application of a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS) method to quantify everolimus using VAMS. For the quantification, 
      (13)C(2)D(4)-Everolimus was used as internal standard (IS). Everolimus and the IS 
      were extracted with methanol from the VAMS device, which was evaporated after 
      ultrasonification and shaking. The residue was reconstituted in 20 mM ammonium 
      formate buffer and methanol (50%, v/v) of which 5 μL was injected into the 
      LC-MS/MS system. Quantification was performed for the ammonium adduct of 
      everolimus in positive electrospray ion mode. The VAMS method met all pre-defined 
      validation criteria. Accuracy and precision were within 11.1% and ≤14.6%, 
      respectively. Samples were shown to be stable on the VAMS device for at least 
      362 days at ambient temperatures. Considerable biases from -20 to 31% were 
      observed over a 30-50% hematocrit range. Although the method fulfilled all 
      validation criteria, the perceived advantage of VAMS over dried blood spot 
      sampling could not be demonstrated. Despite the effect of hematocrit, using an 
      empirically derived formula the whole blood everolimus concentration could be 
      back calculated with reasonable accuracy in the clinical application study.

AB  - Folate receptor (FR)-β has been identified as a promising target for 
      antimacrophage and antiinflammatory therapies. In the present study, we 
      investigated EC0565, a folic acid-derivative of everolimus, as a FR-specific 
      inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Because of its amphiphilic 
      nature, EC0565 was first evaluated for water solubility, critical micelle 
      formation, stability in culture and FR-binding specificity. Using FR-expressing 
      macrophages, the effect of EC0565 on mTOR signaling and cellular proliferation 
      was studied. The pharmacokinetics, metabolism and bioavailability of EC0565 were 
      studied in normal rats. The in vivo activity of EC0565 was assessed in rats with 
      adjuvant arthritis, a "macrophage-rich" model with close resemblance to 
      rheumatoid arthritis. EC0565 forms micellar aggregates in physiological buffers 
      and demonstrates good water solubility as well as strong multivalent FR-binding 
      capacity. EC0565 inhibited mTOR signaling in rat macrophages at nanomolar 
      concentrations and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in serum-starved RAW264.7 
      cells. Subcutaneously administered EC0565 in rats displayed good bioavailability 
      and a relatively long half-life (~12 h). When given at 250 nmol/kg, EC0565 
      selectively inhibited proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression in 
      thioglycollate-stimulated rat peritoneal cells. With limited dosing regimens, the 
      antiarthritic activity of EC0565 was found superior to that of etanercept, 
      everolimus and a nontargeted everolimus analog. The in vivo activity of EC0565 
      was also comparable to that of a folate-targeted aminopterin. Folate-targeted 
      mTOR inhibition may be an effective way of suppressing activated macrophages in 
      sites of inflammation, especially in nutrient-deprived conditions, such as in the 
      arthritic joints. Further investigation and improvement upon the physical and 
      biochemical properties of EC0565 are warranted.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This investigator-initiated study explores the safety, maximum 
      tolerated dose, clinical response, and pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine 
      (HCQ) with and without erlotinib in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung 
      cancer. METHODS: Patients with prior clinical benefit from an epidermal growth 
      factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor were randomized to HCQ or HCQ 
      plus erlotinib in a 3 + 3 dose-escalation schema. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients 
      were treated, eight with HCQ (arm A) and 19 with HCQ plus erlotinib (arm B). EGFR 
      mutations were detected in 74% of the patients and 85% had received two or more 
      prior therapies. Arm A had no dose-limiting toxicities, but the maximum tolerated 
      dose was not reached as this arm closed early to increase overall study accrual. 
      In arm B, one patient each experienced grade 3 rash, nail changes, skin changes, 
      nausea, dehydration, and neutropenia; one had grade 4 anemia; and one developed 
      fatal pneumonitis, all considered unrelated to HCQ. There were no dose-limiting 
      toxicities, therefore the highest tested dose for HCQ with erlotinib 150 mg was 
      1000 mg daily. One patient had a partial response to erlotinib/HCQ, for an 
      overall response rate of 5% (95% confidence interval, 1-25). This patient had an 
      EGFR mutation and remained on therapy for 20 months. Administration of HCQ did 
      not alter the pharmacokinetics of erlotinib. CONCLUSIONS: HCQ with or without 
      erlotinib was safe and well tolerated. The recommended phase 2 dose of HCQ was 
      1000 mg when given in combination with erlotinib 150 mg.

      titration design with sequential escalating flat doses of deforolimus 
      administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once daily for 5 consecutive 
      days every 2 weeks (QDx5) in a 28-day cycle. Safety, pharmacokinetic, 
      pharmacodynamic, and tumor response assessments were performed. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-two patients received at least one dose of deforolimus (3 to 28 mg/d). 
      Three dose-limiting toxicity events of grade 3 mouth sores were reported. The 
      maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 18.75 mg/d. Common treatment-related adverse 
      events included reversible mouth sores and rash. Whole-blood clearance increased 
      with dose. Pharmacodynamic analyses demonstrated mammalian target of rapamycin 
      inhibition at all dose levels. Four patients (one each with non-small-cell lung 
      cancer, mixed müllerian tumor [carcinosarcoma], renal cell carcinoma, and Ewing 
      sarcoma) experienced confirmed partial responses, and three additional patients 
      had minor tumor regressions. CONCLUSION: The MTD of this phase I trial using an 
      accelerated titration design was determined to be 18.75 mg/d. Deforolimus was 
      well tolerated and showed encouraging antitumor activity across a broad range of 
      malignancies when administered intravenously on the QDx5 schedule. On the basis 
      of these overall results, a dose of 12.5 mg/d is being evaluated in phase II 
      trials.

TI  - Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, Electronic Health Records, and Pharmacokinetic 
      Modeling to Evaluate Sirolimus Drug Exposure-Response Relationships in Renal 
      Transplant Patients.
PG  - 600-6

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sirolimus, an immunosuppressive agent used in renal transplantation, 
      can prevent allograft rejection. Identification of the therapeutic index (the 
      ratio of minimum toxic concentration to minimum therapeutic concentration) for 
      immunosuppresants is necessary to optimize the care of patients and set standards 
      for bioequivalence evaluation of sirolimus products. However, the therapeutic 
      index for sirolimus has been inconsistently defined, potentially because of 
      inconsistencies in sirolimus exposure-response relationships. METHODS: The 
      authors used retrospective therapeutic drug monitoring data from the electronic 
      health records of patients treated in a tertiary health care system from 2008 to 
      2014 to (1) develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model, (2) use the model to 
      simulate sirolimus concentrations, and (3) characterize the exposure-response 
      relationship. Using Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher exact tests, the authors 
      determined relationships between sirolimus exposure and adverse events (AEs) 
      (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hyperlipidemia, and decline in renal 
      function) and the composite efficacy end point of graft loss or rejection. 
      RESULTS: The developed 2-compartment population PK model showed appropriate 
      goodness of fit. In a late-phase (>12 months), postrenal transplant population of 
      27 inpatients, the authors identified statistically significant relationships 
      between 83 simulated peak and trough sirolimus concentrations and outcomes: graft 
      loss or rejection (P = 0.018) and decline in renal function (P = 0.006), 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Use of therapeutic drug monitoring results and PK 
      modeling permitted correlation of sirolimus concentrations with graft loss or 
      rejection and decline in renal function. However, the method was limited in its 
      assessment of other AEs. To better evaluate sirolimus exposure-response 
      relationships, the method should be applied to a larger sample of newly 
      transplanted patients with a higher propensity toward AEs or efficacy failure.

TI  - Absence of interaction between rivaroxaban, tacrolimus and everolimus in renal

AB  - No data are available on rivaroxaban use in renal transplant recipients and on 
      its surmised interaction with immunosuppressants. The aim was to investigate 
      potential interactions between rivaroxaban and immunosuppressants in this 
      setting. Renal transplant recipients with a stable renal function treated with 
      rivaroxaban and tacrolimus with or without everolimus were investigated. All 
      drugs and creatinine concentrations were determined daily for 2 weeks after the 
      start of anticoagulation. Blood samples were drawn at 8.00 am and 3-4 h later for 
      trough and peak concentrations, respectively. Bleeding and thrombotic events were 
      recorded during a minimum follow-up of 6 months. In 8 renal transplant patients, 
      rivaroxaban levels showed a predictable pharmacokinetic trend, both at C(trough) 
      (30-61 μg/L) and at C(peak) (143-449 μg/L), with limited variability in the 
      25th-75th percentile range. Tacrolimus (C(trough) 3-13 μg/L; C(peak) 3-16 μg/L), 
      everolimus (C(trough) 3-11 μg/L; C(peak) 5-17 μg/L) and creatinine concentrations 
      were stable as well. Immunosuppressors variability before and after rivaroxaban 
      were 30% and 30% for tacrolimus, 27% and 29% for everolimus, respectively, as 
      well as 14% and 3% for creatinine. For rivaroxaban monitoring, the reference 
      change value better performed in identifying significant variations of its 
      concentration. No patient had bleeding or thrombotic events, worsening of renal 
      graft function, and signs of immunosuppressants toxicity during a mean follow-up 
      of 23 (9-28) months. In conclusion, rivaroxaban does not seem to interact with 
      tacrolimus and everolimus in renal transplant recipients. Both anticoagulant and 
      immunosuppressive effects seem warranted, without major bleeding complications 
      and effect on the graft function.

AB  - Sirolimus is regarded as one of the most effective immunosuppressants receiving 
      extensive attention over the years, for which the ocular application needs 
      further development in clinical keratoplasty. In order to study the transcorneal 
      absorption effect of ophthalmic administration, there was a need to study the 
      pharmacokinetics of drugs in aqueous humor. In this work, a validated and 
      reliable HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was established to study the pharmacokinetics of 
      sirolimus nanoformulations in rabbit aqueous humor. The analysis conditions were 
      as follows. Ascomycin was chosen as internal standard. After a simple 
      precipitation extraction procedure, the aqueous humor samples were separated on a 
      XBridge C18 column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, 3.5 μm, Waters Co., USA) with a mobile phase 
      comprised of water (0.1% formic acid and 5 mM ammonium formate) and methanol 
      (0.1% formic acid) at the ratio of 10:90 (v/v). The mass analysis was achieved by 
      positive ionization with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The highest 
      response ion pairs m/z at 931.5→864.5 were chosen for sirolimus. The validated 
      results showed that the calibration range was 0.3-100.6 ng/mL with r = 0.9997 
      (n = 6). The R.S.D. values of the intra- and inter-day precision were less than 
      11% and the average accuracy values were between 94.73%-100.20%. Besides, for 
      reducing the consumption of rabbits and the variation of the data, we designed a 
      consecutive sampling method in pharmacokinetic study, with only seven rabbits 
      consumed for each formulation. In conclusion, the developed analysis method was 
      more reliable and practical than previously reported experiments. Meanwhile, the 
      validated method was successfully applied to study the pharmacokinetics of 
      sirolimus micelle and sirolimus nanosuspension after ophthalmic administration.

TI  - Short sirolimus half-life in pediatric renal transplant recipients on a 
      calcineurin inhibitor-free protocol.
PG  - 171-7
AB  - Immunosuppression with SRL may provide an opportunity to avoid long-term exposure 
      to the nephrotoxicity of CNI. Thus, we have initiated an experimental protocol of 
      IL-2r antibody induction, prednisone, MMF and SRL in pediatric renal transplant 
      recipients (median age 15.5 yr, IQR 8.5, range 1.3-21.7). The recipients were 
      treated with daclizumab every 2 wk for the first 2 months, prednisone on a 
      tapering schedule, MMF at 1200 mg/m(2)/day and SRL given b.i.d. The SRL was dosed 
      to achieve defined target whole blood 12-h trough levels. We performed 24 SRL PK 
      profiles in 13 stable pediatric renal transplant recipients at 1 and 3 months 
      post-transplant. Half-life (T(1/2)) and terminal T(1/2) were 9.7 (7.1-24.6) and 
      10.8 (4.4-95.2) hours (median, range) respectively at month 1, and were 9.6 
      (5-17.8) and 12.1 (4.7-71.0) hours respectively at month 3. SRL trough levels 
      correlated with AUC (r(2) = 0.84, p < 0.001). There was no relationship between 
      SRL and mycophenolic acid (MPA) AUC values (r(2) = 0.04). During the first 3 
      months post-transplant only one patient experienced severe neutropenia and 
      another patient had subclinical (histologic) evidence of a mild acute rejection 
      episode with no change in renal function. We conclude that the T(1/2) of SRL in 
      pediatric renal transplant recipients not treated with CNI is much shorter than 
      what has been reported for adults, due to rapid metabolism. We conclude that 
      children require SRL dosing every 12 h, higher doses and frequent drug monitoring 
      to achieve target SRL concentrations.

TI  - CYP3A5 genotype does not influence everolimus in vitro metabolism and clinical 
      pharmacokinetics in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 652-6
LID - 10.1097/TP.0b013e31820ae4ac [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: CYP3A5 genotyping might be useful to guide tacrolimus and sirolimus 
      dosing. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of CYP3A5 polymorphism 
      on everolimus metabolism and pharmacokinetics. METHODS: We investigated the 
      effect of CYP3A5 6986A>G polymorphism (CYP3A5*1/*3 alleles) on the 
      pharmacokinetics of everolimus in 28 renal transplant patients and on its in 
      vitro hepatic metabolism using a bank of genotyped human liver microsomes (n=49). 
      We further evaluated in vitro the contribution of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C8 to 
      everolimus hepatic metabolism using recombinant enzymes. RESULTS: We found no 
      association between CYP3A5 polymorphism and everolimus pharmacokinetics in renal 
      transplant patients. On the other hand, no effect of CYP3A5 polymorphism was 
      observed on the intrinsic clearance of everolimus by human liver microsomes, 
      whereas that of tacrolimus (positive control) was 1.5-fold higher in microsomes 
      carrying the CYP3A5*1 allele than in noncarriers. In vitro data showed that 
      CYP3A4 is a better catalyst of everolimus metabolism than CYP3A5, whereas the 
      opposite was observed for tacrolimus. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides direct and 
      indirect evidence that CYP3A5 genotyping cannot help improve everolimus therapy.

TI  - A phase 2 clinical trial of deforolimus (AP23573, MK-8669), a novel mammalian 
      target of rapamycin inhibitor, in patients with relapsed or refractory 
      hematologic malignancies.
PG  - 2756-62
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1372 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Deforolimus (AP23573), a novel non-prodrug rapamycin analogue, inhibits 
      the mammalian target of rapamycin, a downstream effector of the 
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and nutrient-sensing pathways. A phase 2 trial 
      was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of single-agent deforolimus in 
      patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL 
      DESIGN: Eligible patients were assigned to one of five disease-specific, parallel 
      cohorts and given 12.5 mg deforolimus as a 30-minute infusion once daily for 5 
      days every 2 weeks. A Simon two-stage design was used for each cohort. Safety, 
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor response were assessed. 
      RESULTS: Fifty-five patients received deforolimus as follows: cohort 1 23 acute 
      myelogenous leukemia, two myelodysplastic syndrome and one chronic myelogenous 
      leukemia in nonlymphoid blast phase; cohort 2, one acute lymphocytic leukemia; 
      cohort 3, nine agnogenic myeloid metaplasia; cohort 4, eight chronic lymphocytic 
      leukemia; cohort 5, nine mantle cell lymphoma and two T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. 
      Most patients were heavily pretreated. Of the 52 evaluable patients, partial 
      responses were noted in five (10%), two of seven agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and 
      three of nine mantle cell lymphoma. Hematologic improvement/stable disease was 
      observed in 21 (40%). Common treatment-related adverse events, which were 
      generally mild and reversible, were mouth sores, fatigue, nausea, and 
      thrombocytopenia. Decreased levels of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 in 9 of 11 acute 
      myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome patients after therapy showed 
      mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition by deforolimus. CONCLUSIONS: Deforolimus 
      was well-tolerated in patients with heavily pretreated hematologic malignancies, 
      and antitumor activity was observed. Further investigation of deforolimus alone 
      and in combination with other therapeutic agents is warranted in patients with 
      selected hematologic malignancies.

AB  - A patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection and end-stage renal disease 
      received a renal transplant. At the time of surgery, the patient was on quadruple 
      antiretroviral therapy (lamivudine, zidovudine, and amprenavir/ritonavir). 
      Immunosuppression was initiated with basiliximab, corticosteroid, mycophenolate 
      mofetil, and a single 0.5 mg dose of tacrolimus. In the following days, an 
      increase in tacrolimus concentration was observed with a peak of 37 ng/mL. 
      Tacrolimus half-life was 6.5 days and tacrolimus maintenance dose was 0.5 mg 
      every 4 days. Eleven months later, the patient had developed Kaposi sarcoma. 
      Tacrolimus was replaced by sirolimus (first dose 1 mg), and the patient was 
      stabilized with 1.5 mg of sirolimus once a week. Increased tacrolimus half-life 
      and increased dose interval of sirolimus and tacrolimus were due to CYP3A4/5 
      and/or P-glycoprotein inhibition by protease inhibitors. Close monitoring is 
      required in the management of tacrolimus and sirolimus dosing regimens when 
      combined with ritonavir boosted HIV-1 protease inhibitors.

TI  - The role of organic anion-transporting polypeptides and their common genetic 
      variants in mycophenolic acid pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 100-8
LID - 10.1038/clpt.2009.205 [doi]
AB  - The goal of this study was to determine the roles of the organic 
      anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) OATP1A2, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 and their 
      genetic variants in the pharmacokinetics of the immunosuppressive drug 
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Using OATP-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 
      cells, we measured the uptake of mycophenolic acid (MPA) and its glucuronide 
      (MPAG). MPAG, but not MPA, significantly accumulated in cells expressing OATP1B3 
      or OATP1B1 (P < 0.05). The pharmacokinetics of both MPA and MPAG were 
      significantly influenced by the OATP1B3 polymorphism 334T>G/699G>A in 70 renal 
      transplant patients receiving combination treatment of MMF with either tacrolimus 
      or sirolimus, but not in 115 patients receiving MMF and cyclosporine. The 
      decrease in dose-normalized (dn) MPA exposure and the concomitant increase in the 
      MPAG/MPA metabolic ratio are consistent with reduced enterohepatic cycling in 
      patients carrying the OATP1B3 334G-699A haplotype. Further studies demonstrated 
      that this variant of OATP1B3 exhibited a reduced maximal velocity (V(max)) in 
      transfected HEK cells, thereby providing functional evidence to support our 
      clinical findings.

TI  - Effects of the novel protein kinase C inhibitor AEB071 (Sotrastaurin) on rat 
      cardiac allograft survival using single agent treatment or combination therapy 
      with cyclosporine, everolimus or FTY720.

AB  - NVP-AEB071 (AEB, sotrastaurin), an oral inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), 
      effectively blocks T-cell activation. The immunosuppressive effects of oral AEB 
      were demonstrated in a rat local graft versus host (GvH) reaction and rat cardiac 
      transplantation models. T-cell activation was suppressed by 95% in blood from 
      AEB-treated rats, with a positive correlation between T-cell inhibition and AEB 
      blood concentration. In GvH studies, AEB inhibited lymph node swelling 
      dose-dependently (3-30 mg/kg). BN and DA cardiac allografts were acutely rejected 
      within 6-10 days post-transplantation in untreated LEW rats. AEB at 10 and 30 
      mg/kg b.i.d. prolonged BN graft survival to a mean survival time of 15 and >28 
      days, and DA grafts to 6.5 and 17.5 days, respectively. In the DA to LEW model, 
      combining a nonefficacious dose of AEB (10 mg/kg b.i.d.) with a nonefficacious 
      dose of cyclosporine, everolimus or FTY720 led to prolonged median survival times 
      (26 days, >68 days and >68 days, respectively). Pharmacokinetic monitoring 
      excluded drug-drug interactions, suggesting synergy. In conclusion, these studies 
      are the first to demonstrate that AEB prolongs rat heart allograft survival 
      safely as monotherapy and in combination with nonefficacious doses of 
      cyclosporine, everolimus or FTY720. Thus, AEB may have the potential to offer an 
      alternative to calcineurin inhibitor-based therapies.

TI  - Everolimus but not mycophenolate mofetil therapy is associated with soluble HLA-G 
      expression in heart transplant patients.
PG  - 1193-7
LID - 10.1016/j.healun.2009.07.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), a protein primarily expressed 
      during pregnancy, helps maintain maternal-fetal immune tolerance. Myocardial 
      and/or soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) expression confers protection against rejection and 
      vasculopathy after heart transplantation. Although the precise mechanisms remain 
      unclear, immunosuppressive therapy has been reported to influence this 
      expression. METHODS: We compared sHLA-G expression in heart transplant recipients 
      receiving two different anti-proliferative agents: mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 
      and everolimus (RAD). Twelve-hour pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were conducted in 
      patients after cyclosporine (CsA) administration in conjunction with RAD or MMF, 
      during which plasma HLA-G concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked 
      immunoassay (ELISA). RESULTS: Among patients receiving RAD, 78% expressed 
      detectable levels of plasma HLA-G (1,002 +/- 511 ng/ml) compared with 25% of 
      patients receiving MMF (612 +/- 438 ng/ml, p = 0.03). In all sHLA-G(+) patients, 
      expression remained constant, with no significant changes in HLA-G levels 
      throughout the 12-hour PK study period. CsA did not appear to influence sHLA-G 
      expression, as there was no correlation between HLA-G levels and CsA exposure 
      (R(2) = 0.43, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest a 
      disproportionate expression of HLA-G in patients under two distinct 
      immunosuppression strategies after heart transplantation. Although CsA 
      administration does not influence sHLA-G levels, RAD but not MMF is associated 
      with sHLA-G expression. Larger prospective clinical investigations are required 
      to confirm whether RAD is independently associated with increased HLA-G 
      expression.

TI  - A pharmacokinetic interaction between clarithromycin and sirolimus in kidney 
      transplant recipient.
PG  - 379-81
AB  - Bacterial infection is a frequent event in renal transplant recipients and often 
      requires the use of antimicrobial agents. In this paper it is reported an 
      evidence of pharmacokinetic interaction between clarithromycin and sirolimus in a 
      kidney transplanted woman, suffering from pulmonary infection sustained by a 
      bacterial pathogen, in particular Hemophilus Influenzae. In the present case 
      report, the concomitant administration of clarithromycin and sirolimus determined 
      impressive increase of sirolimus trough blood concentrations from 6.2 up to 54 
      ng/mL and this increase was associated with an acute impairment of renal 
      function, almost completely reversed upon both drugs discontinuation. This 
      drug-drug interaction is due to a likely inhibition of activity of both 
      cytochrome P450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein. Although this interaction could be 
      predicted, it represents the first reported clinical evidence.

TI  - Prediction of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions using human hepatocyte 
      suspension in plasma and cytochrome P450 phenotypic data. III. In vitro-in vivo 
      correlation with fluconazole.
PG  - 1261-6
LID - 10.1124/dmd.107.019000 [doi]
AB  - Whereas ketoconazole is often used to study the worst-case scenario for clinical 
      pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) for drugs that are primarily 
      metabolized by CYP3A4, fluconazole is considered to be a moderate inhibitor of 
      CYP3A4, providing assessment of the moderate-case scenario of CYP3A-based DDIs. 
      Fluconazole is also a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. For predicting 
      clinical DDIs using conventional approaches, determining the in vivo inhibitor 
      concentration at the enzymatic site [I], a critical parameter, is still not 
      practical. In our previous study, a novel method involving hepatocyte suspension 
      in plasma was used to circumvent the need to determine the elusive [I] value. In 
      this study, the CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 activities remaining in the 
      presence of fluconazole were determined in human hepatocytes suspended in human 
      plasma, covering a range of fluconazole clinical plasma concentrations (C(avg) 
      and C(max)). Because the protein-binding effect of fluconazole is expected to be 
      close to that in vivo, the inhibition observed in vitro will be similar to that 
      in vivo. This inhibition information was then applied to the cytochrome P450 
      (P450) phenotypic data to predict DDIs. Using the available P450 phenotypic 
      information on theophylline, tolbutamide, omeprazole, S-warfarin, phenytoin, 
      cyclosporine, and midazolam and that determined in this study for sirolimus and 
      tacrolimus, we found that the predictions for area under the curve increases for 
      most of these drugs in the presence of fluconazole were remarkably similar 
      (within 35%) to the observed clinical values. This study proves the general 
      applicability of our approach using human hepatocyte incubation in human plasma 
      to predict DDIs.

TI  - Lipids-based nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) for improved oral 
      bioavailability of sirolimus.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to improve the oral bioavailability of 
      sirolimus (SRL), a poorly water-soluble immunosuppressant, by encapsulating into 
      lipids-based nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). SRL-loaded NLCs (SRL-NLCs) 
      were prepared by a high-pressure homogenization method with glycerol distearates 
      (PRECIROL ATO-5) as the solid lipid, oleic acid as the liquid lipids, and Tween 
      80 as the emulsifier. The SRL-NLCs prepared under optimum conditions was 
      spherical in shape with a mean particle size of about 108.3 nm and an entrapment 
      efficiency of 99.81%. In vitro release of SRL-NLCs was very slow, about 2.15% at 
      12 h, while in vitro lipolysis test showed fast digestion of the NLCs within 1 h. 
      Relative oral bioavailability of SRL-NLCs in Beagle dogs was 1.81-folds that of 
      the commercial nanocrystalline sirolimus tablets Rapamune®. In conclusion, the 
      NLCs show potential to improve the oral bioavailability of SRL.

TI  - Model-Informed Drug Development for Everolimus Dosing Selection in Pediatric 
      Infant Patients.
PG  - 230-237
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12502 [doi]
AB  - Everolimus is currently approved in Europe as an adjunctive therapy for patients 
      aged ≥ 2 years with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated 
      treatment-refractory partial-onset seizures, based on the EXIST-3 study 
      (NCT01713946) results. As TSC-associated seizures can also affect children aged 
      between 6 months and 2 years, a modeling and simulation (M&S) approach was 
      undertaken to extrapolate exposure (trough plasma concentration (C(min) )) after 
      a dose of 6 mg/m(2) and reduction in seizure frequency (RSF). A physiologically 
      based pharmacokinetic model using Simcyp was developed to predict C(min) in adult 
      and pediatric patients, which was then used by a population pharmacodynamic model 
      and a linear mixed effect model to predict short-term and long-term efficacy in 
      adults (for validation) and in children, respectively. Based on the results of 
      the M&S study, everolimus at the dose of 6 mg/m(2) is anticipated to be an 
      efficacious treatment in children 6 months to 2 years of age (up to 77.8% RSF) 
      with concentrations within the recommended target range.

TI  - A phase II study of continuous oral mTOR inhibitor everolimus for recurrent, 
      radiographic-progressive neurofibromatosis type 1-associated pediatric low-grade 
      glioma: a Neurofibromatosis Clinical Trials Consortium study.
PG  - 1527-1535
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/noaa071 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is 
      observed in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) associated low-grade gliomas (LGGs), 
      but agents that inhibit this pathway, including mTOR inhibitors, have not been 
      studied in this population. We evaluate the efficacy of the orally administered 
      mTOR inhibitor everolimus for radiographically progressive NF1-associated 
      pediatric LGGs. METHODS: Children with radiologic-progressive, NF1-associated LGG 
      and prior treatment with a carboplatin-containing chemotherapy were prospectively 
      enrolled on this phase II clinical trial to receive daily everolimus. Whole blood 
      was analyzed for everolimus and markers of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase 
      (PI3K)/mTOR pathway inhibition. Serial MRIs were obtained during treatment. The 
      primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 48 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-three 
      participants (median age, 9.4 y; range, 3.2-21.6 y) were enrolled. All 
      participants were initially evaluable for response; 1 patient was removed from 
      study after development of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Fifteen of 
      22 participants (68%) demonstrated a response, defined as either shrinkage (1 
      complete response, 2 partial response) or arrest of tumor growth (12 stable 
      disease). Of these, 10/15 remained free of progression (median follow-up, 33 mo). 
      All remaining 22 participants were alive at completion of therapy. Treatment was 
      well tolerated; no patient discontinued therapy due to toxicity. Pharmacokinetic 
      parameters and pre-dose concentrations showed substantial between-subject 
      variability. PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibition markers demonstrating blood mononuclear 
      cell mTOR pathway inactivation was achieved in most participants. CONCLUSION: 
      Individuals with recurrent/progressive NF1-associated LGG demonstrate significant 
      disease stability/shrinkage during treatment with oral everolimus with a 
      well-tolerated toxicity profile. Everolimus is well suited for future 
      consideration as upfront or combination therapy in this patient population.

TI  - Sirolimus: the evidence for clinical pharmacokinetic monitoring.
PG  - 769-86
AB  - This review seeks to apply a decision-making algorithm to establish whether 
      clinical pharmacokinetic monitoring (CPM) of sirolimus (rapamycin) in solid organ 
      transplantation is indicated in specific patient populations. The need for CPM of 
      sirolimus, although a regulatory requirement in Europe, has not yet been firmly 
      established in North America and other parts of the world. Sirolimus has 
      demonstrated immunosuppressive efficacy in renal, pancreatic islet cell, liver 
      and heart transplant recipients. The pharmacological response of 
      immunosuppressive therapy with sirolimus cannot be readily evaluated; however, a 
      relationship between trough blood sirolimus concentrations, area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) and the incidence of rejection has been proposed. 
      Furthermore, sirolimus can be measured in whole blood by several 
      assays--high-performance liquid chromatography with detection by tandem mass 
      spectrometry, or with ultraviolet detection, radioreceptor assay or microparticle 
      enzyme immunoassay. Both experimental animal and clinical data suggest that 
      adverse events and their associated severity are correlated with blood 
      concentrations. To prevent rejection and minimise toxicity, a therapeutic range 
      of 4-12 microg/L (measured via chromatographic assays) is recommended when 
      sirolimus is used in conjunction with ciclosporin. If ciclosporin therapy is 
      discontinued, a target trough range of 12-20 microg/L is recommended. Sirolimus 
      pharmacokinetics display large inter- and intrapatient variability, which may 
      change in specific patient populations due to disease states or concurrent 
      immunosuppressants or other interacting drugs. Due to the long half-life of 
      sirolimus, dosage adjustments would ideally be based on trough levels obtained 
      more than 5-7 days after initiation of therapy or dosage change. Once the initial 
      dose titration is complete, monitoring sirolimus trough concentrations weekly for 
      the first month and every 2 weeks for the second month appears to be appropriate. 
      After the first 2 months of dose titration, routine CPM of sirolimus is not 
      necessary in all patients, but may be warranted to achieve target concentrations 
      in certain populations of patients, but the frequency of further monitoring 
      remains to be determined and should be individualised.

TI  - Physiologically based pharmacokinetic models for everolimus and sorafenib in 
      mice.
PG  - 1219-29
LID - 10.1007/s00280-013-2116-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Everolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor approved 
      as an immunosuppressant and for second-line therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor used 
      as first-line therapy in HCC and RCC. This study assessed the pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) of everolimus and sorafenib alone and in combination in plasma and tissues, 
      developed physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models in mice, and 
      assessed the possibility of PK drug interactions. METHODS: Single and multiple 
      oral doses of everolimus and sorafenib were administered alone and in combination 
      in immunocompetent male mice and to severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice 
      bearing low-passage, patient-derived pancreatic adenocarcinoma in seven different 
      studies. Plasma and tissue samples including tumor were collected over a 24-h 
      period and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). 
      Distribution of everolimus and sorafenib to the brain, muscle, adipose, lungs, 
      kidneys, pancreas, spleen, liver, GI, and tumor was modeled as perfusion 
      rate-limited, and all data from the diverse studies were fitted simultaneously 
      using a population approach. RESULTS: PBPK models were developed for everolimus 
      and sorafenib. PBPK analysis showed that the two drugs in combination had the 
      same PK as each drug given alone. A twofold increase in sorafenib dose increased 
      tumor exposure tenfold, thus suggesting involvement of transporters in tumor 
      deposition of sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: The developed PBPK models suggested the 
      absence of PK interaction between the two drugs in mice. These studies provide 
      the basis for pharmacodynamic evaluation of these drugs in patient-derived 
      primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas explants.

TI  - Immunosuppressive drug monitoring of sirolimus and cyclosporine in pediatric 
      patients.
PG  - 424-8
AB  - Sirolimus is primarily used as a rescue agent in pediatric transplant recipients, 
      particularly in cases of cyclosporine or tacrolimus toxicity. Preliminary data 
      indicate a higher apparent oral clearance in younger children (4-10 years of 
      age). Various drug interactions have been described between sirolimus and drugs 
      that are substrates/inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A and the P-glycoprotein 
      transporter. Close monitoring of trough sirolimus blood levels is therefore 
      recommended for pediatric transplant recipients. In de novo adult kidney 
      transplant recipients on triple therapy with cyclosporine, corticosteroids and 
      sirolimus, a therapeutic window of 4-12 microg/l is recommended for sirolimus 
      trough concentrations determined by HPLC or LC/MS-MS. In maintenance adult 
      patients after conversion to a calcineurin inhibitor-free regimen, sirolimus 
      trough concentrations of 5-10 microg/l are proposed in combination with 
      mycophenolate mofetil. These therapeutic ranges may also serve as a guide for 
      pediatric renal transplant recipients. The concept of C2 monitoring still needs 
      to be critically evaluated in pediatric patients. The crucial importance of 
      achieving an adequate cyclosporine exposure early after transplantation has been 
      demonstrated for adult transplant recipients. A cyclosporine concentration taken 
      2 h after dosing is a good surrogate marker of the AUC0-4h in adults. Various 
      clinical studies have shown that in pediatric patients, the C2 concentration 
      shows a substantially better correlation with cyclosporine exposure compared to 
      the trough level (C0). In an outcome study with pediatric renal transplant 
      recipients, it could be demonstrated that the AUC(0-4h) was a predictor of acute 
      rejection in the first 3 weeks after transplantation, whereas C2 levels showed no 
      significant association. Abbreviated AUC strategies may be preferable for 
      optimization of CsA exposure in pediatric patients.

TI  - Phase I/II study of sorafenib in combination with temsirolimus for recurrent 
      glioblastoma or gliosarcoma: North American Brain Tumor Consortium study 05-02.
PG  - 1511-8
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/nos264 [doi]
AB  - The activity of single-agent targeted molecular therapies in glioblastoma has 
      been limited to date. The North American Brain Tumor Consortium examined the 
      safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of combination therapy with sorafenib, a 
      small molecule inhibitor of Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, 
      and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β, and temsirolimus (CCI-779), an 
      inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin. This was a phase I/II study. The 
      phase I component used a standard 3 × 3 dose escalation scheme to determine the 
      safety and tolerability of this combination therapy. The phase II component used 
      a 2-stage design; the primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival 
      (PFS6) rate. Thirteen patients enrolled in the phase I component. The maximum 
      tolerated dosage (MTD) for combination therapy was sorafenib 800 mg daily and 
      temsirolimus 25 mg once weekly. At the MTD, grade 3 thrombocytopenia was the 
      dose-limiting toxicity. Eighteen patients were treated in the phase II component. 
      At interim analysis, the study was terminated and did not proceed to the second 
      stage. No patients remained progression free at 6 months. Median PFS was 8 weeks. 
      The toxicity of this combination therapy resulted in a maximum tolerated dose of 
      temsirolimus that was only one-tenth of the single-agent dose. Minimal activity 
      in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme was seen at the MTD of the 2 combined 
      agents.

TI  - Optimal everolimus concentration is associated with risk reduction for acute 
      rejection in de novo renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 31-7
LID - 10.1097/TP.0b013e3181de1d67 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Everolimus (Evl) plus tacrolimus (Tac) in de novo renal 
      transplantation is effective and safe. Whether the concentration of Evl affects 
      efficacy and safety in a Tac-based regimen has not been previously reported. AIM: 
      To evaluate whether the concentration of Evl affects biopsy-proven acute 
      rejection (BPAR), renal function, adverse events (AEs); and to assess for 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions. METHODS: Data were from a prospective, 
      multicenter, open-label, randomized, exploratory 6-month study of 92 renal 
      transplant patients treated de novo with concentration-controlled Evl (target 
      trough levels > or =3 ng/mL) plus low-dose Tac or Evl plus standard-dose Tac; 
      both groups received basiliximab and corticosteroids. Data were pooled across 
      study arms to examine BPAR rates in patients with Evl trough levels less than 3 
      (n=26), 3 to 8 (n=62), or more than 8 ng/mL (n=4). Groups were stratified by both 
      Evl and Tac trough levels to evaluate glomerular filtration rate and AEs. Evl and 
      Tac PK interactions were evaluated in a subset of 14 patients. RESULTS: Evl 
      trough level of more than or equal to 3 ng/mL was associated with significantly 
      lower rates of BPAR as compared with a trough level of less than 3 ng/mL. 
      Glomerular filtration rate was similar at 6 months for both the low and standard 
      Tac groups. No apparent PK interactions were observed between Evl and Tac. AEs 
      were infrequent and did not seem to be associated with the Evl or Tac level. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Evl trough levels > or =3 ng/mL plus Tac are associated with low 
      rates of BPAR without adversely affecting renal function. No evident PK 
      interaction exists between Evl and Tac.

TI  - Temporal decline in sirolimus elimination immediately after pancreatic islet 
      transplantation.
PG  - 492-500
AB  - Pancreatic islet transplantation is a curable treatment for type 1 diabetes and 
      has been put into practice in various countries. In this study, we analyzed the 
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of sirolimus and tacrolimus in six Japanese 
      patients with pancreatic islet transplants immediately after surgery, and 
      monitored efficacy and toxicity. The patients were treated with immunosuppressive 
      therapy based on the Edmonton protocol, that is, sirolimus and low-dose 
      tacrolimus. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using the nonlinear 
      mixed-effects modeling program NONMEM. Large inter- and intra-individual 
      variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus and tacrolimus. A 
      model with increased apparent clearance in the postoperative period explained 
      well the intra-individual variability in the pharmacokinetics of both drugs. The 
      most frequent drug-induced toxicity was a decrease in the white blood cell count, 
      and two of six patients required the administration of granulocyte 
      colony-stimulating factor. Clinical laboratory tests immediately before the 
      transplantation and cytochrome P450 3A5 genotype were not related to the high 
      blood concentrations of sirolimus after the loading dose. From these results, the 
      apparent clearance of sirolimus and tacrolimus might temporally decline 
      immediately after pancreatic islet transplantation. A high trough concentration 
      of sirolimus might increase the risk of hematological toxicy, and adjustment of 
      the dosage for immunosuppressive treatment will be necessary in Japanese 
      patients.

TI  - Valproic acid reduces the tolerability of temsirolimus in children and 
      adolescents with solid tumors.
PG  - 415-21
LID - 10.1097/CAD.0b013e32835dc7c5 [doi]
AB  - A pediatric study has established a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for temsirolimus 
      (Tem) of more than 150 mg/m intravenously/week. A phase I trial was conducted to 
      establish the MTD for Tem in combination with valproic acid (VPA) in children and 
      adolescents with refractory solid tumors. The secondary aims included expression 
      of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) markers on archival tumor tissue; Tem 
      pharmacokinetics; assessment of histone acetylation (HA); and tumor response. 
      Patients were treated with VPA (5 mg/kg orally three times daily) with a target 
      serum level of 75-100 mcg/ml. Tem was started at an initial dose of 60 mg/m/week. 
      Pharmacokinetics and HA measurements were performed during weeks 1 and 5. Two of 
      the first three patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 mucositis). 
      Tem at 35 mg/m/week was found to be tolerable. Peak Tem concentrations were 
      higher in all patients compared with those in previously published reports of 
      single agent Tem. Increases in HA are correlated with VPA levels. All tumor 
      samples expressed mTORC1 and mTORC2. An objective response was observed in one 
      patient (melanoma), whereas transient stable disease was observed in four other 
      patients (spinal cord ependymoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, medullary thyroid 
      carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma). The MTD of Tem when administered with 
      VPA is considerably lower than when used as a single agent, with mucositis the 
      major dose-limiting toxicity. The combination merits further study and may have 
      activity in melanoma. Attention to drug-drug interactions will be important in 
      future multiagent trials including Tem.

TI  - Everolimus drug interactions: application of a classification system for clinical 
      decision making.
PG  - 421-6
AB  - More than half of all drugs used in medical practice are metabolized by 
      cytochrome CYP3A. Coadministration of drugs that share this elimination pathway 
      may lead to pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Efforts are underway by clinical, 
      drug development and regulatory scientists to classify CYP3A-related drug 
      interactions with the ultimate goal of improving guidance for clinical 
      intervention. The CYP3A inhibitory classification system ranks inhibitors 
      according to the fold-increase in area-under-the-curve (AUC) of a probe substrate 
      as: strong (> or =5-fold), moderate (>2.0- to 4.9-fold), or weak (< or 
      =2.0-fold). This classification system was applied to characterize everolimus as 
      a CYP3A substrate.Methods. Five open-label crossover drug interaction studies 
      were performed in 12-16 healthy subjects each. Subjects received a single 2 mg 
      dose of everolimus alone and again during single- or multiple-dose treatment with 
      the probe inhibitors ketoconazole, erythromycin, verapamil, cyclosporine and 
      atorvastatin.Results. The fold-increase in everolimus AUC was: 15.0 with the 
      strong inhibitor ketoconazole; 4.4, 3.5 and 2.7 with the moderate inhibitors 
      erythromycin, verapamil and cyclosporine; and no change with the weak inhibitor 
      atorvastatin. Subjects with low baseline AUCs when everolimus was given alone 
      tended to have AUC increases of a higher magnitude (more potent interaction) in 
      the presence of an inhibitor.Conclusions. Strong CYP3A inhibitors should be 
      avoided when possible during everolimus treatment as compensatory everolimus dose 
      reductions could be difficult to manage. Everolimus therapeutic drug monitoring 
      should be used to guide individualized dose adjustments when moderate CYP3A 
      inhibitors are added to or withdrawn from the regimen. Routine everolimus 
      therapeutic drug monitoring should be sufficient to determine whether dose 
      adjustments are needed when weak CYP3A inhibitors are coadministered. This 
      rational and systematic approach to drug interactions on everolimus yielded 
      clinically useful, structured guidelines for dose adjustment.

TI  - The novel immunosuppressant FTY720 induces peripheral lymphodepletion of both T- 
      and B-cells in cynomolgus monkeys when given alone, with Cyclosporine Neoral or 
      with RAD.
PG  - 177-87
AB  - OBJECTIVE: FTY720 is a new immunosuppressant active in transplantation models, 
      which modulates lymphocyte recirculation, leading to transient peripheral 
      lymphopenia and increased lymphocytes in lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. Here, 
      we investigated the susceptibility of cynomolgus monkeys to FTY720 given orally 
      either alone or in combination with two other immunosuppressants, Cyclosporin 
      Neoral or RAD, as an introductory study to transplantation protocols. METHODS: 
      Each of the three phases of the study comprised a 3-week treatment period with 
      FTY720 administered daily orally at 0.3, 0.1 or 0.03 mg/kg/day, respectively, 
      followed by a 3-week recovery. FTY720 was given as single compound during the 
      first week and in combination with Neoral at 20 mg/kg/day p.o. or RAD at 0.5 
      mg/kg/day p.o. during the subsequent 2 weeks. MAIN FINDINGS: These treatment 
      regimen were well tolerated, except for some body weight loss at high FTY720 dose 
      (0.3 mg/kg/day). FTY720 treatment resulted in a rapid decrease of white blood 
      cell counts which reached a plateau after 3 days. A decrease in both T- and 
      B-lymphocyte counts by up to 80-90% was seen with FTY720 doses of 0.1 and 0.3 
      mg/kg/day. FTY720 blood levels, both trough levels and AUC(0-24 h), showed a 
      linear relationship with FTY720 dose. The reduction in lymphocyte counts was not 
      directly proportional to FTY720 blood levels. The exposure to FTY720 
      significantly increased upon coadministration of Neoral. This pharmacokinetic 
      interaction was not observed for coadministration of RAD. However, the peripheral 
      lymphodepletion was slightly increased after coadministration of RAD but not of 
      Neoral. This may be related to the intrinsic effects of RAD on hematopoietic 
      cells. CONCLUSIONS: FTY720 given orally was effective in terms of peripheral T- 
      and B-lymphodepletion and was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys even in 
      combination with Cyclosporine Neoral or RAD, indicating that such combination 
      protocols could be used in allo- and xenotransplantation in this species. 
      However, the data indicate a potentiation of FTY720 exposure by CsA 
      coadministration and additional lymphodepletion by coadministration of FTY720 and 
      RAD which should be carefully monitored.

TI  - Management of metabolic cytochrome P450 3A4 drug-drug interaction between 
      everolimus and azole antifungals in a renal transplant patient.
PG  - 481-486
LID - 10.2165/00044011-200929070-00006 [doi]
AB  - We report a case of a 54-year-old male renal transplant patient who received 
      antifungal azole treatment in combination with the recently introduced 
      immunosuppressant agent everolimus to prevent post-transplantation aspergillosis 
      reactivation. Voriconazole was withdrawn after 1 month because of elevated 
      concentrations (5 mg/L trough plasma determination) and hepatotoxicity, and 
      substituted by several months of treatment with posaconazole (observed 
      concentration range 1-2 mg/L). We observed pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
      between both voriconazole and posaconazole, and everolimus cytochrome P450 3A4 
      metabolism, resulting in 7.5- and 3.8-fold increase, respectively, in everolimus 
      blood trough concentrations. Combined therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of both 
      everolimus and azole inhibitors allowed for safe and convenient modification of 
      everolimus dosage, which was tapered to maintain a target range of 5-15 ng/mL 
      during and after antifungal treatments. While significant in their effects, these 
      drug interactions were able to be managed safely through a careful approach to 
      management and use of individual TDM.

TI  - Co-delivery of rapamycin- and piperine-loaded polymeric nanoparticles for breast 
      cancer treatment.
PG  - 2608-2616
AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux is the major cause of multidrug resistance (MDR) in 
      tumors when using anticancer drugs, moreover, poor bioavailability of few drugs 
      is also due to P-gp efflux in the gut. Rapamycin (RPM) is in the clinical trials 
      for breast cancer treatment, but its P-gp substrate property leads to poor oral 
      bioavailability and efficacy. The objective of this study is to formulate and 
      evaluate nanoparticles of RPM, along with a chemosensitizer (piperine, PIP) for 
      improved oral bioavailability and efficacy. Poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) 
      was selected as polymer as it has moderate MDR reversal activity, which may 
      provide additional benefits. The nanoprecipitation method was used to prepare 
      PLGA nanoparticles with particle size below 150 nm, loaded with both drugs (RPM 
      and PIP). Prepared nanoparticles showed sustained in vitro drug release for 
      weeks, with initial release kinetics of zero order with non-Fickian transport, 
      subsequently followed by Higuchi kinetics with Fickian diffusion. An everted gut 
      sac method was used to study the effect of P-gp efflux on drug transport. This 
      reveals that the uptake of the RPM (P-gp substrate) has been increased in the 
      presence of chemosensitizer. Pharmacokinetic studies showed better absorption 
      profile of RPM from polymeric nanoparticles compared to its suspension 
      counterpart and improved bioavailability of 4.8-folds in combination with a 
      chemosensitizer. An in vitro cell line study indicates higher efficacy of 
      nanoparticles compared to free drug solution. Results suggest that the use of a 
      combination of PIP with RPM nanoparticles would be a promising approach in the 
      treatment of breast cancer.

TI  - Higher exposure to mycophenolic acid with sirolimus than with cyclosporine 
      cotreatment.
PG  - 34-42
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic drug monitoring of mycophenolate mofetil is recommended 
      because of the interindividual variability in the exposition to its active 
      moiety, mycophenolic acid. However, most of the pharmacokinetic studies involved 
      patients cotreated with cyclosporine (INN, ciclosporin). METHODS: We analyzed the 
      pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid in 13 renal graft recipients treated with 
      sirolimus in an anticalcineurin-free regimen and compared it with that of 17 
      patients cotreated with cyclosporine. The area under the concentration versus 
      time curve over a 12-hour period (AUC 0-12 ) of mycophenolic acid was estimated 
      at 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after transplantation. RESULTS: At 
      the first 3 time points, patients cotreated with sirolimus had significantly 
      higher mycophenolic acid AUC 0-12 values compared with patients cotreated with 
      cyclosporine, as follows: 81 mg . h/L (SD, 39 mg . h/L) versus 43 mg . h/L (SD, 
      11 mg . h/L) (P < .001), 72 mg . h/L (SD, 17 mg . h/L) versus 48 mg . h/L (SD, 13 
      mg . h/L) (P < .001), and 70 mg . h/L (SD, 25 mg . h/L) versus 47 mg . h/L (SD, 
      17 mg . h/L) (P < .01) at week 2, month 1, and month 2, respectively. At all time 
      points, patients cotreated with sirolimus had significantly higher 
      dose-normalized mycophenolic acid AUC 0-12 values. At months 1 and 2, white blood 
      cell counts were lower in the sirolimus group than in the cyclosporine group, as 
      follows: 4.8 x 10(3)/mL (SD, 1.1 x 10(3)/mL) versus 6.5 x 10(3)/mL (SD, 2.2 x 
      10(3)/mL) (P < .01) at month 1 and 4.6 x 10(3)/mL (SD, 1.1 x 10(3)/mL) versus 5.9 
      x 10(3)/mL (SD, 2.0 x 10(3)/mL) (P < .05) at month 2. CONCLUSION: These data show 
      that exposure to mycophenolic acid is higher in patients cotreated with sirolimus 
      than in those cotreated with cyclosporine.

TI  - ABCB1 haplotype influences the sirolimus dose requirements in Chinese renal 
      transplant recipients.
PG  - 164-72
LID - 10.1002/bdd.1881 [doi]
AB  - Sirolimus, an immunosuppressive drug used to prevent organ rejection after renal 
      transplantation, has a narrow therapeutic index and a large inter-individual 
      variability of pharmacokinetics. The aim of this study was to analyse the 
      dose-normalized trough blood concentrations (C0 /D ratio) of sirolimus in 
      patients with different genotypes and attempt to investigate the possible 
      associations between ABCB1/CYP3A5 genotypes and sirolimus dose requirements in 
      Chinese renal transplant recipients. Blood samples were collected from 85 Chinese 
      renal transplant recipients who were treated with sirolimus for at least 3 months 
      and polymorphisms of the ABCB1 and CYP3A5 were determined by the SNaPShot 
      multiplex assay. The blood concentrations of sirolimus were determined with HPLC. 
      A significant allele-dependent effect was observed between the CYP3A5*3 
      polymorphism and the C0 /D ratio of sirolimus. The patients bearing at least one 
      CYP3A5*1 allele had a lower sirolimus C0/D ratio compared with those with a 
      homozygous CYP3A5*3 genotype (p < 0.05). No significant differences of sirolimus 
      C0/D ratios were observed among various ABCB1 1236C>T, 2677G>T/A and 3435C>T 
      genotype groups. However, haplotype analysis including ABCB1 1236C>T, 2677G>T/A 
      and 3435C>T SNPs showed that the mean sirolimus C0/D of subjects carrying the 
      CGC/CGC diplotype was about 30% lower compared with those carrying the CGC/TTT or 
      TTT/TTT diplotype, whether or not they expressed the CYP3A5 (p < 0.05). These 
      results demonstrated that the haplotype of ABCB1 might be a better index for the 
      prediction of sirolimus blood concentration than single SNPs. Genotyping of ABCB1 
      and CYP3A5 might help to optimize individualized sirolimus treatments for Chinese 
      renal transplant recipients.

TI  - Influence of the UGT2B7 promoter region and exon 2 polymorphisms and 
      comedications on Acyl-MPAG production in vitro and in adult renal transplant 
      patients.
PG  - 321-30
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The polymorphic enzyme UGT2B7 metabolizes mycophenolic acid into 
      acyl-mycophenolic acid-glucuronide (AcMPAG), a presumably toxic metabolite. This 
      study aimed at investigating in vitro and in vivo the impact on AcMPAG production 
      of: (i) the UGT2B7 gene G-842A single nucleotide polymorphism, in complete 
      linkage disequilibrium with most other known single nucleotide polymorphisms in 
      the promoter region of this gene and with the C802T single nucleotide 
      polymorphism in exon 2 (UGT2B*2); and (ii) of the other immunosuppressants given 
      to renal transplant patients in association with mycophenolate mofetil. METHODS: 
      We compared the production of AcMPAG by human liver microsomes genotyped for the 
      UGT2B7 G-842A and C802T single nucleotide polymorphisms, and plasma AcMPAG 
      concentrations in genotyped renal transplant patients administered mycophenolate 
      mofetil associated with sirolimus (n=40), tacrolimus (n=24) or cyclosporin (n=28) 
      and decreasing doses of corticosteroids, over the first 3 months after 
      transplant. The effect of corticosteroids was also investigated in vitro using 
      rats' liver microsomes. RESULTS: The two polymorphisms studied were in complete 
      reverse linkage disequilibrium. AcMPAG production was 1.25 and 1.56-fold higher 
      in G-842A and -842AA human liver microsomes, respectively, compared with GG-842 
      human liver microsomes (P=0.01). Enzyme kinetics showed 1.4 and 3.7-fold higher 
      Vmax in the respective pools of human liver microsomes. Km values were 0.20, 0.25 
      and 0.44 mmol/l for the GG-842, G-842A and -842AA genotypes, respectively. This 
      clear increase in Vmax is in favor of the implication of the promoter region 
      polymorphisms, whereas the slighter increase in Km might be due to the UGT2B7*2 
      single nucleotide polymorphism. Consistently, the UGT2B7 genotype significantly 
      influenced AcMPAG area under the curve (AUC0-9 h)/dose in patients on sirolimus 
      at months 1 and 3 after transplant (P=0.04 for both). No effect was observed in 
      patients on tacrolimus and possibly also on cyclosporin, maybe owing to 
      pharmacokinetic interaction with mycophenolate. AcMPAG production was increased 
      in corticosteroid-induced rat liver microsomes, consistent with the observed 
      in-vivo decrease of mycophenolic acid metabolites AUC0-9 h/dose with time after 
      transplant. CONCLUSION: Both UGT2B7 polymorphisms and co-medications 
      significantly influenced AcMPAG production, but cyclosporin and tacrolimus 
      hindered the phenotypic impact of this trait.

TI  - Everolimus and PTK/ZK show synergistic growth inhibition in the orthotopic 
      BL16/BL6 murine melanoma model.
PG  - 193-200
LID - 10.1007/s00280-010-1307-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Everolimus (RAD001, Afinitor) is an mTORC1 pathway inhibitor, and 
      vatalanib (PTK/ZK) is a pan VEGF-R tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). These two 
      drugs have been shown to have overlapping but also distinct anti-angiogenic 
      effects. Consequently, we investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of their combination in vivo. METHODS: Murine melanoma 
      B16/BL6 cells were grown orthotopically in BL6/C57 mice by injection into the 
      derma of both ears to create a primary tumour which metastasized rapidly to the 
      cervical lymph nodes. Mice were treated daily p.o. with PTK/ZK (100 mg/kg) or 
      everolimus (1 mg/kg) or their combination, and anti-tumour efficacy (PD) 
      assessed. In the same model, plasma PK of everolimus was measured following 
      single doses of the monotherapy or combination schedules. RESULTS: Two 
      independent experiments showed that combination of everolimus and PTK/ZK caused 
      at least additive increases in anti-tumour activity compared to either 
      monotherapy, without increases in toxicity. Pooling the data to improve the 
      statistical power demonstrated the interactions to be synergistic. PK modelling 
      showed that although PTK/ZK increased everolimus plasma concentrations by about 
      twofold, this PK drug-drug interaction could not account for the increased 
      anti-tumour effect of the combination. Modelling of the PTK/ZK dose-response 
      curve in this model suggested that any effect of everolimus on the PK of PTK/ZK 
      was unlikely to affect efficacy. Measurement of changes in tumour and plasma VEGF 
      levels at the endpoint of therapy confirmed earlier observations of differential 
      effects of these two agents. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of everolimus and 
      PTK/ZK hold promise for the treatment of human cancers.

TI  - Angiographic and clinical outcomes of a pharmacokinetic study of 
      sirolimus-eluting stents: lesson from restenosis cases.
PG  - 1196-201
AB  - BACKGROUND: A pharmacokinetic (PK) study was conducted to evaluate 
      sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) in Japanese people, representing the first 
      clinical trial of the use of drug-eluting stents in Japan. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      The PK study was conducted in 20 patients with 30 lesions treated with 
      sirolimus-coated BX Velocity stents. All lesions were treated with a single SES 
      (3 x 18 mm). Angiographic follow-up was performed at 8 months after SES 
      implantation, and the clinical outcomes were evaluated at 1 year in all cases. 
      All procedures were successful, and all patients were discharged without any 
      adverse cardiac events. The total restenosis rate was 10% (3 lesions) and target 
      vessel revascularization was performed in those 3 cases (15%). Restenoses 
      occurred at the proximal and distal stent margins. Intravascular ultrasound 
      examination of restenosis cases revealed abundant plaque burden at the stent 
      edges even though the luminal area was preserved. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      sirolimus-eluting BX Velocity stent is safe and useful for Japanese patients with 
      coronary artery disease. However, restenosis at proximal stent edge seems to be a 
      problem.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of local periadventitial delivery of sirolimus for improving 
      hemodialysis graft patency: first human experience with a sirolimus-eluting 
      collagen membrane (Coll-R).
PG  - 1219-24
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr667 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neointimal hyperplasia causes a high rate of hemodialysis synthetic 
      graft failure. Thus, therapies that inhibit neointimal hyperplasia are urgently 
      needed. The Coll-R is a sirolimus-eluting collagen matrix designed for 
      intra-operative perivascular implantation around the graft-venous anastomosis. 
      Sirolimus is an anti-proliferative drug that has proven clinical utility in 
      suppressing neointimal tissue growth in coronary artery disease when delivered 
      locally to the vascular wall by an endovascular drug eluting stent. METHODS: A 
      cohort of 12 chronic hemodialysis patients underwent surgical placement of 13 
      polytetrafluoroethylene grafts + Coll-R and were followed for up to 24 months. 
      The primary endpoint was safety (freedom from device related adverse events). 
      Secondary endpoints were pharmacokinetics of sirolimus release, success of Coll-R 
      implantation and primary unassisted graft patency. RESULTS: There were no 
      technical failures, infections, vascular anastomotic or wound-healing problems. 
      Whole blood sirolimus levels rose to a mean peak of 4.8 ng/mL at 6 h and fell to 
      <1 ng/mL at 1 week (n = 5). Twelve and 24-month primary unassisted patencies were 
      76 and 38%, respectively, and the thrombosis rate was 0.37/patient-year. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Perivascular implantation of the Coll-R during graft surgery safely 
      delivered sirolimus to the vascular wall. Systemic sirolimus levels were 
      sub-therapeutic for immunosuppression. This small first-in-human study supports 
      the concept that the Coll-R can safely deliver sirolimus to the graft-venous 
      anastomosis. Safety and patency in this small study were sufficiently encouraging 
      to justify randomized controlled trials to further test the efficacy of the 
      Coll-R.

TI  - Immunosuppressant pharmacokinetics and dosing modifications in HIV-1 infected 
      liver and kidney transplant recipients.
PG  - 2816-20
AB  - Solid organ transplantation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected 
      individuals requiring concomitant use of immunosuppressants (IS) (e.g. 
      cyclosporine [CsA], sirolimus [SrL], tacrolimus [FK]) and antiretrovirals (ARVs) 
      (e.g. protease inhibitors [PIs] and/or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase 
      inhibitors [NNRTIs]) is complicated by significant drug interactions. To assist 
      in appropriate clinical management, we describe the pharmacokinetics and dosing 
      modifications in 35 patients (20 kidney, 13 liver and two kidney-liver 
      HIV-infected subjects with end-stage kidney or liver disease), on both IS and 
      NNRTIs, PIs, and combined NNRTIs + PIs, in studies done at weeks 2-4 and/or 12 
      weeks after transplantation or after a change in IS or ARV drug regimen (n = 97 
      studies). CsA, SrL and FK concentrations were measured in whole blood by LC/MS. 
      HIV-infected transplant recipients using PIs with IS had marked increases in CsA, 
      FK or SrL trough levels compared to those on NNRTIs alone or to patients not on 
      ARVs, necessitating either a reduction in dose or an increase in dosing interval. 
      Subjects on efavirenz (EFV) and CsA required much higher doses of CsA than those 
      using any other ARV. Changes in antiretroviral therapy should be carefully 
      managed to avoid insufficient immunosuppression or toxicity due to drug 
      interactions.

TI  - Simultaneous quantification of tacrolimus and sirolimus, in human blood, by 
      high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 608-12
AB  - In this paper the authors present a validated method for the simultaneous 
      analysis of tacrolimus and sirolimus in human blood by high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Blood samples (500 microL) 
      were prepared by C18 solid-phase extraction. Mass spectrometric detection was by 
      selected reaction monitoring. The assay was linear for both compounds over the 
      range 0.25-100 microg/L (r2 > 0.996, n = 7). At the limit of quantification (0.25 
      microg/L), for both sirolimus and tacrolimus, the interday imprecision was < 3% 
      and the analytical recovery was between 97.0% and 102%, respectively. The 
      interbatch and intrabatch coefficients of variation of the method for both 
      analytes, at the three quality control concentrations (0.5, 20, and 80 microg/L), 
      were < 16% and < 10%, respectively. The analytical recovery, at the three control 
      concentrations, ranged from 99.2% to 104% of the nominal concentration. The mean 
      absolute recovery (+/- standard deviation) of tacrolimus, sirolimus, and internal 
      standard was 82 +/- 7%, 89 +/- 12%, and 77 +/- 8%, respectively (n = 12). In 
      conclusion, the method presented can be used for simultaneous determination of 
      tacrolimus and sirolimus and will aid in pharmacokinetic studies and therapeutic 
      drug monitoring of these drugs. Furthermore, this method has economic benefits in 
      the clinical setting where these drugs are coadministered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Janus kinase (JAK)3 is crucial for signal transduction downstream of 
      various cytokine receptors in immune cells. This is the first report on the novel 
      JAK3 inhibitor R348. METHODS: (1) Detailed pharmacokinetic data were obtained in 
      rats; (2) multiple in vitro enzyme inhibition assays were performed to 
      characterize the drug; (3) prevention of acute rejection was investigated in 
      animals treated with different doses of R348 or rapamycin for 5 days; and (4) 
      cardiac allograft survival after a 10-day treatment period was studied for 
      various regimens of R348, tacrolimus, or rapamycin; combination indices were 
      calculated to evaluate drug interactions. RESULTS: (1) Plasma levels of R348's 
      active metabolite R333 sustained high for 8 hr or more, depending on the dose. 
      (2) In vitro enzyme assays showed potent inhibition of JAK3- and Syk-dependent 
      pathways. (3) R348 40 mg/kg preserved graft function, significantly reduced graft 
      infiltration, and decreased histologic ISHLT rejection scores on postoperative 
      day 5. Results were similar to those of rapamycin 3 mg/kg. Likewise, both drugs 
      significantly reduced the cellular Th1 and Th2 immune responses, as determined by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Intragraft inflammatory cytokine upregulation 
      was similarly suppressed by R348 and rapamycin. R348 10 mg/kg was subtherapeutic. 
      (4) Allograft survival was similar for R348 20 and 40 mg/kg, which was comparable 
      with therapeutically dosed tacrolimus or rapamycin. In combination regimens, R348 
      demonstrated highly beneficial synergistic interactions with tacrolimus. 
      CONCLUSIONS: R348 is a promising novel JAK3/Syk-inhibitor with favorable 
      pharmacokinetics and biological activity. It effectively diminishes acute cardiac 
      allograft rejection and is suitable for combination regimens with tacrolimus.

TI  - Phase I Trial of Encapsulated Rapamycin in Patients with Prostate Cancer Under 
      Active Surveillance to Prevent Progression.
PG  - 551-562
LID - 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-20-0383 [doi]
AB  - No approved medical therapies prevent progression of low-grade prostate cancer. 
      Rapamycin inhibits cell proliferation and augments immune responses, producing an 
      antitumor effect. Encapsulated rapamycin (eRapa) incorporates rapamycin into a 
      pH-sensitive polymer, ensuring consistent dosing. Here, we present results from a 
      phase I trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of eRapa in patients with 
      prostate cancer. Patients with Gleason ≤7 (3+4) disease (low and intermediate 
      risk) under active surveillance were enrolled in a 3+3 study with three eRapa 
      dosing cohorts (cohort 1, 0.5 mg/week; cohort 2, 1 mg/week; and cohort 3, 0.5 
      mg/day). Patients were treated for 3 months and followed for an additional 3 
      months to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, quality of life (QoL), immune 
      response, and disease progression. Fourteen patients (cohort 1, n = 3; cohort 2, 
      n = 3; and cohort 3, n = 8) were enrolled. In cohort 3, one dose-limiting 
      toxicity (DLT; neutropenia) and two non-DLT grade 1-2 adverse events (AE) 
      occurred that resulted in patient withdrawal. All AEs in cohorts 1 and 2 were 
      grade 1. Peak serum rapamycin concentration was 7.1 ng/mL after a 1 mg dose. 
      Stable trough levels (∼2 ng/mL) developed after 48-72 hours. Daily dosing mildly 
      worsened QoL, although QoL recovered after treatment cessation in all categories, 
      except fatigue. Weekly dosing increased naïve T-cell populations. Daily dosing 
      increased central memory cell populations and exhaustion markers. No disease 
      progression was observed. In conclusion, treatment with eRapa was safe and 
      well-tolerated. Daily dosing produced higher frequencies of lower grade 
      toxicities and transient worsening of QoL, while weekly dosing impacted immune 
      response. Future studies will verify clinical benefit and long-term 
      tolerability.Prevention Relevance: There is an unmet medical need for a 
      well-tolerated treatment capable of delaying progression of newly diagnosed 
      low-grade prostate cancer. This treatment would potentially obviate the need for 
      future surgical intervention and improve the perception of active surveillance as 
      a more acceptable option among this patient population.

      (TAC) or Mycophenolate (MPS) in Stable Kidney Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 293-9
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000292 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety outcomes of 
      conversion strategies in stable kidney transplant recipients after premature 
      termination of the sotrastaurin (STN) development program. METHODS: This is an 
      exploratory and prospective study, including 38 stable renal transplant 
      recipients. Tacrolimus (TAC) group [STN → mycophenolate sodium (MPS)] consisted 
      of 9 patients receiving TAC, STN, and prednisone that were converted from STN to 
      MPS. Everolimus (EVR) group (STN → TAC) consisted of 29 patients receiving EVR, 
      STN, and prednisone that were converted from STN to TAC. RESULTS: In TAC (STN → 
      MPS) group, dose-adjusted TAC concentrations decreased from baseline to first 
      week (2.3 ± 1.1 versus 1.5 ± 1.0 ng·mL·mg, P < 0.05). Two patients experienced a 
      first acute rejection episode. Conversion to MPS was associated with a higher 
      incidence of adverse events. In EVR (STN → TAC) group, dose-adjusted EVR 
      concentrations decreased from baseline to first week (3.6 ± 2.3 ng·mL·mg versus 
      1.9 ± 0.8 ng·mL·mg, P < 0.01). The proportion of patients with donor-specific 
      antibodies was lower in TAC (STN → MPS) (11%) compared to EVR (STN → TAC) (31%) 
      before conversion. Conversion from STN to TAC was associated with a reduction in 
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (69.6 ± 16.9 versus 61.0 ± 18.8 mL·min·1.73 
      m, P < 0.01) and a decreased proportion of patients with donor-specific 
      antibodies (31% versus 14%) at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Conversion from TAC/STN to 
      TAC/MPS or from EVR/STN to TAC/EVR was associated with significant 
      pharmacokinetic changes in both TAC and EVR whole-blood trough concentrations due 
      to known drug-to-drug interaction, which were associated with changes in efficacy 
      and safety.

AB  - The USFDA-approved immunosuppressive drug rapamycin (Rapa), despite its potency, 
      is limited by poor bioavailability and a narrow therapeutic index. In this study, 
      we sought to improve bioavailability of Rapa with subcutaneous (SC) 
      administration and to test its therapeutic feasibility and practicality in a 
      murine model of Sjögren's syndrome (SS), a systemic autoimmune disease with no 
      approved therapies. To improve its therapeutic index, we formulated Rapa with a 
      carrier termed FAF, a fusion of the human cytosolic FK506-binding protein 12 
      (FKBP12) and an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP). The resulting 97 kDa FAF (i) has 
      minimal burst release, (ii) is "humanized", (iii) is biodegradable, (iv) 
      solubilizes two Rapa per FAF, and (v) avoids organic solvents or amphiphilic 
      carriers. Demonstrating high stability, FAF remained soluble and monodisperse 
      with a hydrodynamic radius of 8 nm at physiological temperature. A complete 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of FAF revealed that the bioavailability of SC FAF 
      was 60%, with significantly higher blood concentration during the elimination 
      phase compared to IV FAF. The plasma concentration of Rapa delivered by FAF was 
      8-fold higher with a significantly increased plasma-to-whole blood ratio relative 
      to free Rapa, 24 h after injection. To evaluate therapeutic effects, FAF-Rapa was 
      administered SC every other day for 2 weeks to male non-obese diabetic (NOD) 
      mice, which develop an SS-like autoimmune-mediated lacrimal gland (LG) 
      inflammation and other characteristic features of SS. Both FAF-Rapa and free Rapa 
      exhibited immunomodulatory effects by significantly suppressing lymphocytic 
      infiltration, gene expression of IFN-γ, MHC II, type I collagen and IL-12a, and 
      cathepsin S (CTSS) activity in LG compared to controls. Serum chemistry and 
      histopathological analyses in major organs revealed no apparent toxicity of 
      FAF-Rapa. Given its improved PK and equipotent therapeutic efficacy compared to 
      free Rapa, FAF-Rapa is of further interest for systemic treatments for autoimmune 
      diseases like SS.

TI  - A pilot study of JI-101, an inhibitor of VEGFR-2, PDGFR-β, and EphB4 receptors, 
      in combination with everolimus and as a single agent in an ovarian cancer 
      expansion cohort.
PG  - 1217-24
LID - 10.1007/s10637-015-0288-5 [doi]
AB  - JI-101 is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth 
      factor receptor type 2 (VEGFR-2), platelet derived growth factor receptor β 
      (PDGFR-β), and ephrin type-B receptor 4 (EphB4). None of the currently approved 
      angiogenesis inhibitors have been reported to inhibit EphB4, and therefore, 
      JI-101 has a novel mechanism of action. We conducted a pilot trial to assess the 
      pharmacokinetics (PK), tolerability, and efficacy of JI-101 in combination with 
      everolimus in advanced cancers, and pharmacodynamics (PD), tolerability, and 
      efficacy of JI-101 in ovarian cancer. This was the first clinical study assessing 
      anti-tumor activity of JI-101 in a combinatorial regimen. In the PK cohort, four 
      patients received single agent 10 mg everolimus on day 1, 10 mg everolimus and 
      200 mg JI-101 combination on day 8, and single agent 200 mg JI-101 on day 15. In 
      the PD cohort, eleven patients received single agent JI-101 at 200 mg twice daily 
      for 28 day treatment cycles. JI-101 was well tolerated as a single agent and in 
      combination with everolimus. No serious adverse events were observed. Common 
      adverse events were hypertension, nausea, and abdominal pain. JI-101 increased 
      exposure of everolimus by approximately 22%, suggestive of drug-drug interaction. 
      The majority of patients had stable disease at their first set of restaging scans 
      (two months), although no patients demonstrated a response to the drug per RECIST 
      criteria. The novel mechanism of action of JI-101 is promising in ovarian cancer 
      treatment and further prospective studies of this agent may be pursued in a less 
      refractory patient population or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy.

AB  - In contrast with the conventional targeting of nanoparticles to cancer cells with 
      antibody or peptide conjugates, a hyaluronic acid (HA) matrix nanoparticle with 
      intrinsic-CD44-tropism was developed to deliver rapamycin for localized 
      CD44-positive breast cancer treatment. Rapamycin was chemically conjugated to the 
      particle surface via a novel sustained-release linker, 3-amino-4-methoxy-benzoic 
      acid. The release of the drug from the HA nanoparticle was improved by 42-fold 
      compared to HA-temsirolimus in buffered saline. In CD44-positive MDA-MB-468 
      cells, using HA as drug delivery carrier, the cell viability was significantly 
      decreased compared to free rapamycin and CD44-blocked controls. Rat 
      pharmacokinetics showed that the area under the curve of HA nanoparticle 
      formulation was 2.96-fold greater than that of the free drug, and the concomitant 
      total body clearance was 8.82-fold slower. Moreover, in immunocompetent BALB/c 
      mice bearing CD44-positive 4T1.2neu breast cancer, the rapamycin-loaded HA 
      particles significantly improved animal survival, suppressed tumor growth and 
      reduced the prevalence of lung metastasis. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: This study 
      demonstrates increased efficiency of rapamycin delivery and consequential 
      treatment effects in a breast cancer model by hyaluronic acid - L-rapamycin 
      conjugates with intrinsic tropism for CD44-positive cells.

TI  - Phase I study of vinblastine and sirolimus in pediatric patients with recurrent 
      or refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 128-33
LID - 10.1002/pbc.24656 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of vinblastine and mammalian target of rapamycin 
      (mTOR) inhibitor sirolimus inhibits the growth of neuroblastoma xenografts 
      through pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic mechanisms. This phase I study aimed to 
      explore the safety and toxicity of this combination in pediatric patients with 
      advanced solid tumors. PROCEDURE: Patients ≤21 years of age with 
      recurrent/refractory solid tumors (including CNS) were eligible. Sirolimus was 
      administered daily by mouth or nasogastric (NG) tube, with doses adjusted to 
      achieve a target trough concentration of 10-15 ng/ml, with weekly intravenous 
      vinblastine (dose escalated 4-6 mg/m(2)/dose according to 3 + 3 phase I design). 
      RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled (median age 8.7 years; range 2.3-19) of 
      whom 12 were evaluable for toxicity and 11 for response. One patient experienced 
      a dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 mucositis) at the highest vinblastine dose 
      level. Myelosuppression was the most common toxicity. Dose-adjusted sirolimus 
      trough concentrations were significantly lower in patients receiving drug via NG 
      tube (1.50 ± 0.75 ng/ml/mg vs. 2.25 ± 1.07 ng/ml/mg for oral administration). 
      Correlative biomarker analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in serum 
      concentration of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (sVEGFR2) at 
      28 days compared to baseline consistent with inhibition of angiogenesis. One 
      patient had a partial response and three had stable disease for more than 3 
      months. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of mTOR inhibitor and vinblastine given over 
      an extended continuous schedule is safe, associated with a reduction in 
      circulating angiogenic factor (CAF) VEGFR2 and resulted in clinical responses. 
      Future studies using the intravenously administered mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus 
      are planned.

TI  - Orthotopic liver transplantation using low-dose tacrolimus and sirolimus.
PG  - 701-8
AB  - Although sirolimus (SRL) binds the immunophilin FK506-binding protein-12 
      (FKBP-12) with greater avidity than tacrolimus (TAC), animal studies have shown 
      that SRL and TAC act synergistically to prevent rejection. Dose-related toxicity 
      is more often the cause of TAC discontinuation than rejection. We hypothesized 
      that SRL would allow for a substantial reduction in the concomitant dose of TAC 
      after liver transplantation to levels less than the threshold for toxicity. A 
      series of 56 liver transplant recipients were administered a combination of SRL 
      and TAC (target trough levels, 7 and 5 ng/mL, respectively). Planned weaning of 
      steroids commenced after 3 months. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were undertaken. 
      Patient and graft survival were 52 patients (93%) and 51 grafts (91%), with a 
      follow-up of 23 months (range, 6 to 35 months). One episode (1.8%) of hepatic 
      artery thrombosis was seen. The rate of acute cellular rejection was 14%. No 
      extra treatment was administered in 3 of 8 patients, and the other 5 episodes 
      responded to a single course of steroids. Cytomegalovirus infection occurred in 4 
      patients (7%). Renal function, glucose control, and lipid metabolism are near 
      normal in 47 patients (84%) without additional medication. Steroid elimination is 
      completed in 51 patients (91%). Bioavailability of SRL and TAC varied between 
      transplant recipients, but trough levels strongly correlated with the area under 
      the curve (r(2) = 0.82 and r(2) = 0.84, respectively). Simultaneous 
      administration did not affect the PK profile of the drugs at this dose. The ratio 
      of trough level to daily dose correlated between SRL and TAC. The synergistic 
      effect seen in animal models also occurs in clinical liver transplant recipients 
      on SRL-TAC combination immunosuppression. A low-dose combination of SRL and TAC 
      should be compared with conventional immunosuppression in a multicenter, 
      randomized, controlled trial.

TI  - Immune Suppression During Preclinical Drug Development Mitigates 
      Immunogenicity-Mediated Impact on Therapeutic Exposure.
PG  - 447-455
LID - 10.1208/s12248-016-0026-8 [doi]
AB  - In the clinical setting, anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against biotherapeutics can 
      influence patient safety and interfere with product efficacy. High immunogenicity 
      has been addressed in clinic by concomitant immune suppression, such as 
      co-administration of methotrexate with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and 
      combination tacrolimus/sirolimus treatment for prophylaxis against organ 
      transplant rejection. This study investigates the use of such immune suppressants 
      in mitigating ADA responses to a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb1) in 
      preclinical animal studies. Three groups of Sprague Dawley rats (n = 18) were 
      treated with low (0.01 mg/kg), moderate (50 mg/kg), or high (300 mg/kg) doses of 
      mAb1. Experimental groups also received either methotrexate or 
      tacrolimus/sirolimus immune suppressive regimens. ELISA-based methods were 
      utilized to measure and characterize ADA and mAb1 pharmacokinetics (PK). Results 
      demonstrated a stepwise increase in immunogenicity with mAb1 dosage. Methotrexate 
      significantly lowered incidence of anti-variable region antibodies at moderate 
      mAb1 dose (P < 0.05), while tacrolimus/sirolimus did likewise at moderate and 
      high doses (P < 0.01) of mAb1. Except for low-dose mAb1 + methotrexate, all 
      immunosuppressed groups displayed more than a 70-fold decrease in ADA magnitude 
      (P < 0.05). This abrogation in ADA response correlated with more mAb1 in 
      circulation by week 4 for moderate- and high-dosed mAb1 groups. These data 
      provide an approach to mitigate preclinical immunogenicity by the use of 
      immunosuppressant regimens. Such preconditioning can support preclinical drug 
      development of human therapeutics that are antigenic to animals. Similar 
      approaches could be investigated for wider application to novel therapeutics.

TI  - Measurement of rapamycin in whole blood using reverse-phase high-performance 
      liquid chromatography.
PG  - 138-41
AB  - Rapamycin (RAPA) is an immunosuppressant with a potency similar to FK 506 and up 
      to 100-fold greater than cyclosporine. To date, no data have been reported on the 
      pharmacokinetics and disposition of the drug, primarily due to a lack of suitable 
      methods for its analysis. We describe here an evaluation of a reverse-phase 
      high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for analysis of the drug in 
      whole blood. The method showed excellent analytical recovery of the drug, close 
      to 100%. The sensitivity method was found to be 1.0 micrograms/L with between-run 
      coefficients of variation of 14.4% and 9.8% at 10 and 50 mg/L. The stability of 
      RAPA was investigated with this method in whole-blood specimens. It was found 
      that the drug was stable for 30 days at 4 degrees C and for 55 days at -40 
      degrees C.

      advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 1603-10
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2007.14.5482 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Everolimus is a selective mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor 
      with promising anticancer activity. In order to identify a rationally based dose 
      and schedule for cancer treatment, we have conducted a tumor pharmacodynamic 
      phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Fifty-five patients were treated with everolimus in cohorts of 20, 50, and 70 mg 
      weekly or 5 and 10 mg daily. Dose escalation depended on dose limiting toxicity 
      (DLT) rate during the first 4-week period. Pre- and on-treatment steady-state 
      tumor and skin biopsies were evaluated for total and phosphorylated (p) protein 
      S6 kinase 1, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (elF-4E) binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), 
      eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF-4G), AKT, and Ki-67 expression. Plasma 
      trough levels of everolimus were determined on a weekly basis before dosing 
      during the first 4 weeks. RESULTS: We observed a dose- and schedule-dependent 
      inhibition of the mTOR pathway with a near complete inhibition of pS6 and peIF-4G 
      at 10 mg/d and >or= 50 mg/wk. In addition, pAKT was upregulated in 50% of the 
      treated tumors. In the daily schedule, there was a correlation between everolimus 
      plasma trough concentrations and inhibition of peIF4G and p4E-BP1. There was good 
      concordance of mTOR pathway inhibition between skin and tumor. Clinical benefit 
      was observed in four patients including one patient with advanced colorectal 
      cancer achieving a partial response. DLTs occurred in five patients: one patient 
      at 10 mg/d (grade 3 stomatitis) and four patients at 70 mg/wk (two with grade 3 
      stomatitis, one with grade 3 neutropenia, and one with grade 3 hyperglycemia). 
      CONCLUSION: Everolimus achieved mTOR signaling inhibition at doses below the DLT. 
      A dosage of 10 mg/d or 50 mg/wk is recommended for further development.

      bioavailability.
PG  - 1499-1508
LID - 10.1080/17425247.2020.1828342 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Everolimus (EVR) has been approved for the treatment of various 
      advanced cancers and its indications are increasingly expanding. Therefore, it is 
      crucial for patients who have difficulty in swallowing, such as pediatric and 
      elderly patients, to obtain a convenient formulation. The oral absorption of EVR 
      is limited due to its low solubility in water, intestinal metabolism by CYP3A4 
      enzyme, P-gp-mediated efflux, and metabolism in the liver. The aim of this study 
      was to develop a novel sublingual orodispersible film loading everolimus for 
      improving patient compliance and enhancing oral bioavailability of EVR. RESEARCH 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: Sublingual orodispersible films loading EVR were prepared by 
      the solvent casting method and evaluated by in vitro and in vivo studies. 
      RESULTS: The properties of films were determined by scanning electron microscopy, 
      differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform 
      infrared spectrometry. The addition of acacia gum appeared to be crucial for 
      protecting the drug from oxidation. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that loading 
      into the sublingual orodispersible films significantly increased the oral 
      bioavailability of EVR. CONCLUSION: The EVR-loaded sublingual orodispersible 
      films are a promising, economical, and convenient approach for delivering EVR 
      efficiently in a solid dosage form.

AB  - Tumor cells disseminate into compartments that are poorly accessible from 
      circulation, which necessitates high doses of systemic chemotherapy. However, the 
      effectiveness of many drugs, such as the potent topoisomerase I poison SN-38, is 
      hampered by poor pharmacokinetics. To deliver SN-38 to lymphoma tumors in vivo, 
      we took advantage of the fact that healthy lymphocytes can be programmed to 
      phenocopy the biodistribution of the tumor cells. In a murine model of 
      disseminated lymphoma, we expanded autologous polyclonal T cells ex vivo under 
      conditions that retained homing receptors mirroring lymphoma cells, and 
      functionalized these T cells to carry SN-38-loaded nanocapsules on their 
      surfaces. Nanocapsule-functionalized T cells were resistant to SN-38 but mediated 
      efficient killing of lymphoma cells in vitro. Upon adoptive transfer into 
      tumor-bearing mice, these T cells served as active vectors to deliver the 
      chemotherapeutic into tumor-bearing lymphoid organs. Cell-mediated delivery 
      concentrated SN-38 in lymph nodes at levels 90-fold greater than free drug 
      systemically administered at 10-fold higher doses. The live T cell delivery 
      approach reduced tumor burden significantly after 2 weeks of treatment and 
      enhanced survival under conditions where free SN-38 and SN-38-loaded nanocapsules 
      alone were ineffective. These results suggest that tissue-homing lymphocytes can 
      serve as specific targeting agents to deliver nanoparticles into sites difficult 
      to access from the circulation, and thus improve the therapeutic index of 
      chemotherapeutic drugs with unfavorable pharmacokinetics.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a downstream mediator 
      in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, and plays a central 
      role in cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, migration, and survival. 
      Temsirolimus (CCI-779), a selective inhibitor of the mTOR, is an ester analog of 
      rapamycin (sirolimus) with improved aqueous solubility and pharmacokinetic (PK) 
      properties. Preclinical studies have confirmed additive and synergistic antitumor 
      activity in cancer cell lines (breast, prostate cancer) with combinations of 
      taxanes and mTOR inhibitors. We conducted a phase I open-label, dose-escalation 
      study to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of docetaxel in combination 
      with temsirolimus in patients with refractory solid tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Eligible patients had a diagnosis of a refractory solid malignancy, measurable 
      disease, and adequate organ function. Patients were sequentially enrolled in 4 
      dose level intravenous combinations of docetaxel and temsirolimus. Temsirolimus 
      was administered weekly with docetaxel administered every 3 weeks. Laboratory 
      data for tumor markers and radiologic imaging were conducted prestudy and then 
      after every 2 cycles of the treatment. Radiologic response was assessed by 
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Blood samples for 
      PK and pharmacodynamic analysis were planned to be drawn at MTD. Apart from the 
      traditional 3+3 design, we also implemented Bayesian Optimal Interval design 
      which uses isotonic regression method to select MTD. We proceeded with isotonic 
      regression analysis by using 20% dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate as target. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were treated in this study in 4 cohorts and dose 
      levels. Fourteen males and 12 females were enrolled with a median age of 50 years 
      (range of 27 to 72 y) and median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 
      score of 1. Tumor histologies included pancreas (6), colon (5), rectum (3), 
      gallbladder (2), non-small cell lung (2), endometrium (1), neuroendocrine (1), 
      esophagus (1), stomach (1), pharynx (1), small intestine (1), and duodenum (1). 
      Stable disease was observed in 2/4 (50%), 3/7 (43%), 4/10 (40%), and 3/5 (60%) 
      patients in cohorts 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Dose escalation in cohorts 2, 
      3, and 4 was complicated by DLTs such as grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 diarrhea 
      and an inability for patients to tolerate treatments during and beyond cycle 1 
      without dose reductions. Therefore, we could not determine an MTD or recommended 
      phase II dose using the traditional 3+3 study analysis. Blood samples for PK and 
      pharmacodynamic analysis were not collected since MTD was not determined. By 
      using 20% DLT rate closest to the target, isotonic regression analysis showed 
      identical estimated DLT rates in dose -1 (docetaxel 50 mg/m2 and temsirolimus 
      15 mg/m2) and dose level 1 (docetaxel 60mg/m2 and temsirolimus 15 mg/m2). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Dose escalation of docetaxel and temsirolimus was limited by severe 
      myelosuppressive toxicity in this phase I study. Most of the DLTs occurred after 
      cycle 1 of therapy hence, we were unable to determine MTD or collect blood 
      samples for PK and pharmacodynamic analysis. Our trial did not meet its 
      objectives due to significant DLTs with this chemotherapy combination. Although 
      our novel use of Bayesian Optimal Interval design using isotonic regression 
      method to select MTD showed identical estimated DLT rates in dose levels 1 and 
      -1, clinically our patients were not able to complete 2 cycles of this regimen 
      without dose reductions due to myelosuppressive toxicity in either of these dose 
      levels, and hence, escaped clinical validity. This combination regimen should not 
      be studied further at the dose levels and schedules tested in our study.

PG  - 1859-68
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1998 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The altered PI3K/mTOR pathway is implicated in lung cancer, but mTOR 
      inhibitors have failed to demonstrate efficacy in advanced lung cancer. We 
      studied the pharmacodynamic effects of everolimus in resectable non-small cell 
      lung cancer (NSCLC) to inform further development of these agents in lung cancer. 
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We enrolled 33 patients and obtained baseline tumor biopsy 
      and 2[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography/computed 
      tomography (FDG-PET/CT) imaging followed by everolimus treatment (5 or 10 mg 
      daily, up to 28 days), or without intervening treatment for controls. Target 
      modulation by everolimus was quantified in vivo and ex vivo by comparing 
      metabolic activity on paired PET scans and expression of active phosphorylated 
      forms of mTOR, Akt, S6, eIF4e, p70S6K, 4EBP1, and total Bim protein between 
      pretreatment and posttreatment tissue samples. RESULTS: There were 23 patients on 
      the treatment arm and 10 controls; median age 64 years; 22 tumors (67%) were 
      adenocarcinomas. There was a dose-dependent reduction in metabolic activity 
      (SUVmax: 29.0%, -21%, -24%; P = 0.014), tumor size (10.1%, 5.8%, -11.6%; P = 
      0.047), and modulation of S6 (-36.1, -13.7, -77.0; P = 0.071) and pS6 (-41.25, 
      -61.57, -47.21; P = 0.063) in patients treated in the control, 5-mg, and 10-mg 
      cohorts, respectively. Targeted DNA sequencing in all patients along with exome 
      and whole transcriptome RNA-seq in an index patient with hypersensitive tumor was 
      employed to further elucidate the mechanism of everolimus activity. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This "window-of-opportunity" study demonstrated measurable, dose-dependent, 
      biologic, metabolic, and antitumor activity of everolimus in early-stage NSCLC.

TI  - Everolimus Exposure and Early Metabolic Response as Predictors of Treatment 
      Outcomes in Breast Cancer Patients Treated with Everolimus and Exemestane.
PG  - 641-648

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treating breast cancer patients with everolimus and exemestane can be 
      challenging due to toxicity and suboptimal treatment responses. OBJECTIVE: We 
      investigated whether everolimus exposure and early metabolic response are 
      predictors for toxicity and effectiveness in these patients. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: We performed pharmacokinetic assessments 14 and 35 days after starting 
      treatment. [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET) 
      was performed at baseline, and 14 and 35 days after the start of the therapy. We 
      recorded toxicity, defined as dose interventions within 3 months, and 
      progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Among 44 evaluable patients, the 
      geometric mean (GM) C(trough) was higher in patients with toxicity compared to 
      patients without (17.4 versus 12.3 μg/L (p = 0.02)). The optimal cut-off value to 
      predict toxicity was C(trough) > 19.2 μg/L. GM C(trough) of patients with and 
      without progressive disease (PD) within 3 months was not significantly different 
      (12.0 versus 15.2 μg/L (p = 0.118)). In 28 evaluable patients, PD within 3 months 
      could best be predicted using the percentage decrease in peak standardized uptake 
      value normalized by lean body mass of the lesion with highest FDG uptake 
      (SUL(peak high)) at day 14. Patients with <11% versus >11% decrease in SUL(peak 
      high) at day 14 had a median PFS of 90 days versus 411 days, respectively 
      (p = 0.0013) and more frequently had PD within 3 months: 70 vs 11%, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that everolimus toxicity is related to everolimus 
      C(trough). No relation was observed between everolimus exposure and treatment 
      effectiveness. An early FDG-PET can identify patients at high risk of 
      nonresponse. These results warrant further validation. Clinicaltrials.gov 
      identifier: NCT01948960.

TI  - Sirolimus Pharmacokinetics Variability Points to the Relevance of Therapeutic 
      Drug Monitoring in Pediatric Oncology.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13040470 [doi]
LID - 470
AB  - Sirolimus is widely used in transplantation, where its therapeutic drug 
      monitoring (TDM) is well established. Evidence of a crucial role for sirolimus in 
      the PI3K/AkT/mTor pathway has stimulated interest in its involvement in 
      neoplasia, either as monotherapy or in combination with other antineoplastic 
      agents. However, in cancer, there is no consensus on sirolimus TDM. In the RAPIRI 
      phase I trial, the combination sirolimus + irinotecan was evaluated as a new 
      treatment for refractory pediatric cancers. Blood sampling at first sirolimus 
      intake (D1) and at steady state (D8), followed by LC/MS(2) analysis, was used to 
      develop a population pharmacokinetic model (Monolix(®) software). A 
      mono-compartmental model with first-order absorption and elimination best fit the 
      data. The only covariate retained for the final model was "body surface area" (D1 
      and D8). The model also demonstrated that 1.5 mg/m(2) would be the recommended 
      sirolimus dose for further studies and that steady-state TDM is necessary to 
      adjust the dosing regimen in atypical profiles (36.4% of the population). No 
      correlation was found between sirolimus trough concentrations and efficacy and/or 
      observed toxicities. The study reveals the relevance of sirolimus TDM in 
      pediatric oncology as it is needed in organ transplantation.

AB  - The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus (RAD001) is a successfully 
      used immunosuppressant in solid-organ transplantation. Several studies have 
      already used RAD001 in combination with calcineurin inhibitors after 
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We investigated calcineurin 
      inhibitor-free pre- and post-transplantation immunosuppression of RAD001 combined 
      with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in a nonmyeloablative HSCT setting. After 
      nonmyeloablative conditioning with 2 Gy total body irradiation, 8 dogs received 
      HSCT from dog leukocyte antigen-identical siblings. Immunosuppressives were given 
      at doses of 1.5 mg RAD001 twice daily from day -1 to +49, then tapered until 
      day +56, and 20 mg/kg MMF from day 0 to +28, then tapered until day +42. An 
      historical cyclosporin A (CsA)/MMF regimen was used in the control group. All 
      dogs engrafted. Median platelet nadir amounted in all dogs to 0 × 10(9)/L 
      (median, day +10; duration <50 × 10(9)/L, 22 days) and median leukocyte nadir was 
      1.0 × 10(9)/L (range, .1 to 2.5 × 10(9)/L; median, day +13). Eventually, 5 of 8 
      (63%) animals rejected their grafts. Two dogs died of infections on day +19 
      and +25. Pharmacokinetics of RAD001 and MMF showed median trough levels of 19.1 
      (range, 10.5 to 43.2) μg/L and .3 (.1 to 1.3) mg/L, respectively. The median area 
      under the curve was 325 (range, 178 to 593) μg/L × hour for RAD001 and 29.6 
      (range, 7.9 to 40.5) ng/L × hour for MMF. All dogs developed clinically mucosal 
      viral infections during the clinical course. Compared with the control group, the 
      level of toxicities for RAD001/MMF increased in all qualities. Combined 
      immunosuppression of RAD001 and MMF after nonmyeloablative HSCT is associated 
      with significant toxicities, including a prolonged platelet recovery time as well 
      as increased infections compared to the CsA/MMF regimen.

TI  - Drug-containing gelatin treats as an alternative to gavage for long-term oral 
      administration in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta).
PG  - 842-6
AB  - Long-term oral administration of immunosuppressive agents to transplanted rhesus 
      monkeys (Macaca mulatta) is one of the major challenges in such studies. To avoid 
      the drawbacks of gavage, we tested an alternative method for oral dosing of 
      sirolimus in rhesus monkeys by adding sirolimus, a commonly used 
      immunosuppressant, to gelatin to create drug-containing gelatin 'treats' that our 
      macaques would accept voluntarily. We evaluated the oral bioequivalence of the 
      oral solution and drug-containing gelatin and assayed the whole-blood levels of 
      sirolimus after long-term drug delivery. We found that time to peak concentration 
      but not peak concentration itself or the area under the time-concentration curve 
      differed between the 2 groups. Although the maximal concentration data did not 
      fit the condition of bioequivalence, those for the time-concentration curves from 
      0 to 24 h and from 0 h to infinity did; therefore the extent of sirolimus 
      absorption did not differ significantly between the 2 formulations. The sirolimus 
      levels for long-term drug delivery were equivalent at 2.97 ± 1.91 ng/mL in the 
      gelatin group and 3.13 ± 2.03 ng/mL in the solution group. The gelatin dosing 
      technique we describe here is convenient and effective for oral administration of 
      sirolimus in rhesus monkeys and likely can be adapted for other drugs.

TI  - The impact of genetic polymorphisms, diltiazem, and demographic variables on 
      everolimus trough concentrations in lung transplant recipients.
PG  - 590-7
LID - 10.1111/ctr.12350 [doi]
AB  - Everolimus (EVR) has inter-individual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability and a 
      narrow therapeutic index. The study objective was to determine whether genetic 
      polymorphisms, co-medications, and/or demographic variables accounted for 
      inter-individual variability in EVR PK in lung transplant recipients (LTxR). LTxR 
      were genotyped for ABCB1 c.1236C>T, ABCB1 c.2677G>T/A, ABCB1 c.3435C>T, 
      CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3, CYP2C8*2/*3/*4, and pregnane X receptor (NR1I2) c.44477T>C, 
      c.63396C>T, c.69789A>G polymorphisms. The primary outcome was the difference in 
      dose-adjusted EVR levels (EVR L/D) between ABCB1 diplotype groups (2 vs. 1 vs. 0 
      copies of the 1236C/2677G/3435C haplotype). Sixty-five LTxR were included. There 
      was no significant difference in EVR L/D between ABCB1 CGC diplotype groups 
      (CGC/CGC = 2.4 ± 1.1 [n = 9] vs. CGC/XXX = 2.5 ± 1.7 [n = 36] vs. XXX/XXX = 2.7 ± 
      1.7 ng/mL per mg/d [n = 20]; p = 0.9). CYP3A5*3, CYP3A4*1B, CYP2C8*3/*4, and 
      NR1I2 polymorphisms were not associated with EVR L/D. EVR L/D was 3.4 ± 1.7 in 
      LTxR receiving diltiazem (DILT) vs. 1.8 ± 1.1 ng/mL per mg/d in LTxR not 
      receiving DILT (p <0.001). Demographic variables, including cystic fibrosis, were 
      not associated with EVR PK. DILT use increased EVR L/D, but selected 
      polymorphisms in ABCB1, CYP3A5, CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and NR1I2 did not affect EVR L/D 
      in LTxR. Genotyping LTxR for these polymorphisms is unlikely to aid clinicians in 
      optimizing EVR therapy.

AB  - To assess the effect of the drug combination of Schisandra sphenanthera extract 
      (SchE) and Rapamycin (RAPA), 18 healthy subjects were given oral treatments of 
      RAPA alone and with SchE. Pharmacokinetic investigations and indexes of hepatic 
      and renal functions, as well as other indices of oral RAPA administration (2 mg), 
      were performed both before and after the SchE treatment period. Whole-blood RAPA 
      concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The research 
      found that the mean whole-blood RAPA AUC(0-∞), C(max), and t(max) increased 
      almost 2-, 2.1-, and 1.3-fold, respectively, and CL/F (-38.0%) decreased almost 
      1.6-fold in these subjects when RAPA was administered with SchE compared with 
      oral RAPA administered alone. The results of this study proved that SchE can 
      increase the oral bioavailability of RAPA and will add important information to 
      the interaction area between drugs and herbal products.

      Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.

AB  - Allelic variants of genes implicated in drug absorption, distribution, 
      metabolism, and excretion (ADME) determine the pharmacokinetic variability of 
      many medications and are increasingly recognized as important factors determining 
      the success or failure of medical treatments. Both tacrolimus and sirolimus have 
      narrow therapeutic ranges maintained by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Using 
      an ADME panel that covers >99% of the PharmaADME working group core list (188 
      single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] and 12 copy number variant [CNV] assays in 
      36 pharmacogenetically relevant genes), we studied 177 patients who underwent 
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using 
      tacrolimus/sirolimus-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. We 
      tested for possible associations between ADME variants and tacrolimus/sirolimus 
      drug levels, concentration/dose (C/D) ratio, and clinical endpoints, including 
      acute GVHD. A total of 62 SNP and 6 CNV assays were evaluable after removing the 
      variants, which were homozygous in (nearly) all samples. For sirolimus, rs2032582 
      (ABCB1) T-carriers versus non-T-carriers were associated with higher blood levels 
      (P = .01), with similar results for C/D ratio. Generalized estimating equation 
      analysis supported these findings. For tacrolimus, rs776746 CYP3A5*3/*3 and 
      CYP3A5*3/*1 were associated with higher blood levels than CYP3A5*1/*1 (P = .002). 
      By multivariable analysis, rs776746 CYP3A5*3/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*1 were 
      independently associated with decreased acute GVHD compared with CYP3A5*1/*1, 
      after adjustment for conditioning, donor type, race/ethnicity, and age. We 
      demonstrated association of specific ADME genetic polymorphisms with blood levels 
      of tacrolimus/sirolimus, and incidence of acute GVHD after HCT, in spite of TDM 
      and dose adjustment. A larger ongoing study will determine whether these 
      associations have clinical utility beyond TDM.

TI  - Multimodal biomarker investigation on efficacy and mechanism of action for the 
      mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, temsirolimus, in a preclinical mammary 
      carcinoma OncoMouse model: a translational medicine study in support for early 
      clinical development.
PG  - 421-9
LID - 10.1124/jpet.111.185249 [doi]
AB  - The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has proven to be a valid therapeutic 
      target in a number of human cancers, and it is a candidate for clinical trials in 
      human breast cancer. We report on a biomarker-based translational medicine 
      approach to assess the efficacy and mechanism of action for the mTOR inhibitor 
      temsirolimus (CCI-779) in a mammary carcinoma OncoMouse model [polyomavirus 
      middle T antigen (PyMT)]. The mTOR signaling pathway biomarkers were assessed 
      using a reverse-phase protein array. Pharmacokinetics studies were conducted in 
      both the tumor and plasma compartments. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers for 
      compound-target engagement of tumor phospho-S6 proteins were assayed by Western 
      blot. Temsirolimus (intravenously once a week for 2 weeks) was administered in 
      both early and advanced stages of tumors. Biomarkers for temsirolimus effects on 
      tumor progression were assessed by three-dimensional ultrasound imaging in 
      combination with immunohistochemistry to assess vascular density (Texas 
      red-dextran and CD31 immunostaining) and macrophage burden (F4/80 antigen). Tumor 
      growth was significantly arrested in temsirolimus (25 ± 14% from 8 to 10 weeks, p 
      < 0.05, and 26 ± 17% from 11 to 13 weeks, p < 0.01), compared with 493 ± 160 and 
      376 ± 50% increases, respectively, in vehicle-treated groups. Temsirolimus 
      reduced tumor vascular density, 36 to 48 and 58 to 60%, p < 0.05, by the Texas 
      red-dextran method or CD31-positive vessel count, respectively. Temsirolimus 
      reduced tumor macrophage burden by 46% at 13 weeks (p < 0.05). Temsirolimus 
      inhibited (p < 0.05) the phosphoproteins S6 pS235/236 and S6 pS240/244 up to 81 
      and 87%, respectively. We conclude that the multimodal biomarkers of temsirolimus 
      efficacy and mechanism of action (phosphoproteins) strongly suggest that it might 
      translate to therapeutic efficacy in human tumors that bear congruency to 
      features present in the mammary carcinoma of PyMT tumors.

      carboplatin ± bevacizumab for advanced NSCLC. METHODS: Adults with advanced NSCLC 
      naive to systemic therapy were enrolled. A Bayesian dose-escalation model was 
      used to identify feasible daily or weekly everolimus doses given with paclitaxel 
      (200 mg/m(2) q21 days) and carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min q21 days) (step 1) and 
      paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2) q21 days), carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL/min q21 days), and 
      bevacizumab (15 mg/kg q21 days) (step 2). Primary endpoint was end-of-cycle 1 
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate. Secondary endpoints included safety; relative 
      dose intensities of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab; pharmacokinetics; 
      and tumor response. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled and received 
      everolimus 5 mg/day plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (step 1 daily; n = 13); 
      everolimus 30 mg/week plus carboplatin and paclitaxel (step 1 weekly; n = 13); 
      everolimus 5 mg/day plus carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab (step 2 daily; 
      n = 13); or everolimus 30 mg/week plus carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab 
      (step 2 weekly; n = 13). End-of-cycle 1 DLT rate was 16.7 % (step 1 daily), 30.8 
      % (step 1 weekly), 30.0 % (step 2 daily), and 16.7 % (step 2 weekly). Cycle 1 
      DLTs were grade 3 neutropenia, anal abscess, diarrhea, and thrombocytopenia and 
      grade 4 myalgia, cellulitis, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, pulmonary 
      embolism, and thrombocytopenia. The most common adverse events were neutropenia, 
      fatigue, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. One patient (step 2 daily) experienced 
      complete response, 10 patients partial response. CONCLUSIONS: The feasible 
      everolimus doses given with carboplatin and paclitaxel ± bevacizumab were 5 
      mg/day and 30 mg/week. Neither schedule was very well tolerated in this 
      unselected NSCLC population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Everolimus-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) (also: 
      pneumonitis) poses a difficulty for physicians, as it is hard to discriminate ILD 
      from other causes of respiratory symptoms and to decide on safe treatment 
      continuation. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the capability of pulmonary function 
      tests (PFT), plasma biomarkers, everolimus pharmacokinetics, and FDG-PET to 
      discriminate between everolimus-related ILD and other causes of respiratory 
      problems and to predict the severity of ILD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women starting 
      treatment with everolimus plus exemestane for advanced breast cancer were 
      included. At baseline and during the first 3 months, respiratory symptoms, PFT 
      with diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide corrected for hemoglobin 
      (DLCOc) and forced vital capacity, serum plasma biomarkers (including SP-D and 
      YKL-40), everolimus trough concentration, and (18)F-FDG-PET were prospectively 
      recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (out of 29 included) patients were evaluable for 
      analysis. Fifteen patients (56%) developed everolimus-related respiratory signs 
      or symptoms and four patients (15%) needed everolimus discontinuation and 
      received corticosteroids. Change in DLCOc differentiated ILD from alternative 
      diagnoses with 0.91 sensitivity and 0.78 specificity. Decrease in DLCOc 
      (non-significant) was greatest in patients who needed everolimus discontinuation. 
      Serum SP-D and YKL-40 could differentiate ILD from alternative diagnoses with 
      0.83 and 0.83 sensitivity, and 0.85 and 0.62 specificity, respectively. 
      (18)F-FDG-PET abnormalities did not precede clinical symptoms. No relationship 
      between ILD and everolimus trough concentration was found. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study shows that everolimus-related ILD occurs frequently. Prospective monitoring 
      of DLCOc in combination with measurement of serum SP-D and YKL-40 appear useful 
      to discriminate ILD from other causes of respiratory symptoms. Clinicaltrials.gov

AB  - BACKGROUND: Everolimus (mammalian target of rapmaycin (mTOR) inhibitor) and 
      dovitinib (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor 
      2 (FGF-2) inhibitor) demonstrate activity in metastatic clear cell renal cancer. 
      The combination of these agents has a broad spectrum of relevant activity. The 
      combination is explored in this phase Ib study. METHODS: Patients with metastatic 
      clear cell renal cancer who have failed VEGF targeted therapy were eligible. Up 
      to four cohorts of three to six patients (3+3 design) were treated with 
      escalating doses of everolimus and dovitinib. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
      were assessed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). An expansion cohort 
      (n=15) was investigated to obtain additional efficacy information. Sequential 
      fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was used as a surrogate 
      marker of response. RESULTS: Overall 18 patients were recruited into the study. 
      Fifteen patients received the MTD, which was everolimus 5mg orally (PO) once 
      daily (OD) and dovitinib 200mg PO day 1-5/7. The MTD was associated with 
      toxicity, which included fatigue, mucositis and diarrhoea in 73%, 53% and 53% 
      (Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 1-4) of patients, respectively. Frequent 
      biochemical abnormalities occurred (such as hypertriglyceridaemia in 67%). Higher 
      doses of the combination were not tolerable due to grade 3 fatigue in 2/3 
      patients and grade 3 nausea in 1/3 patients within 1 month of therapy. The 
      response rate at the MDT was 1/15 (7%) while the progression free survival for 
      the MTD was 7 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-11 months). 
      Pharmacokinetic data at the MTD showed stable kinetics with time. CONCLUSION: 
      Dovitinib and everolimus had modest activity, but did not meet all of the planned 
      efficacy end-points. Fatigue was the dose limiting toxicity.

TI  - Limited sampling strategies for the estimation of sirolimus daily exposure in 
      kidney transplant recipients on a calcineurin inhibitor-free regimen.
PG  - 773-81
LID - 10.1177/0091270009332811 [doi]
AB  - Sirolimus (SRL) is a novel immunosuppressive agent characterized by a narrow 
      therapeutic index. Monitoring of SRL concentrations is mandatory to optimize drug 
      dosing. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) is generally accepted 
      as the best pharmacokinetic marker of daily drug exposure. Assessment of full SRL 
      AUC, however, requires the collection of multiple blood samples, imposing both 
      time and cost constraints. Limited sampling strategies (LSS) may be of clinical 
      relevance to improve the therapeutic drug monitoring of SRL. In this study, 
      stepwise multiple regression analysis is conducted on 30 SRL pharmacokinetic 
      profiles obtained from kidney transplant recipients on a cyclosporine-free 
      regimen, and different LSS equations are identified based on 2 or 3 sampling 
      points collected within the first 6 hours after drug intake. The performance of 
      these equations is tested in a separate validation set (n=30). Most of the 
      proposed algorithms are associated with good correlations with the measured AUC 
      and acceptable bias and imprecision. Two equations--based on 2 time points 
      collected within the first 4 hours after dosing--are identified that reliably 
      predict SRL exposure in routine clinical practice compared with the traditional 
      C0-based approach. These tools provide additional information to optimize SRL 
      therapeutic drug monitoring in renal transplant recipients.

TI  - Phase 0 Clinical Trial of Everolimus in Patients with Vestibular Schwannoma or 
      Meningioma.

AB  - Inhibition of mTORC1 signaling has been shown to diminish growth of meningiomas 
      and schwannomas in preclinical studies, and clinical data suggest that 
      everolimus, an orally administered mTORC1 inhibitor, may slow tumor progression 
      in a subset of patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) with vestibular 
      schwannoma. To assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and potential 
      mechanisms of treatment resistance, we performed a presurgical (phase 0) clinical 
      trial of everolimus in patients undergoing elective surgery for vestibular 
      schwannoma or meningiomas. Eligible patients with meningioma or vestibular 
      schwannoma requiring tumor resection enrolled on study received everolimus 10 mg 
      daily for 10 days immediately prior to surgery. Everolimus blood levels were 
      determined immediately before and after surgery. Tumor samples were collected 
      intraoperatively. Ten patients completed protocol therapy. Median pre- and 
      postoperative blood levels of everolimus were found to be in a high therapeutic 
      range (17.4 ng/mL and 9.4 ng/mL, respectively). Median tumor tissue drug 
      concentration determined by mass spectrometry was 24.3 pg/mg (range, 9.2-169.2). 
      We observed only partial inhibition of phospho-S6 in the treated tumors, 
      indicating incomplete target inhibition compared with control tissues from 
      untreated patients (P = 0.025). Everolimus led to incomplete inhibition of mTORC1 
      and downstream signaling. These data may explain the limited antitumor effect of 
      everolimus observed in clinical studies for patients with NF2 and will inform the 
      design of future preclinical and clinical studies targeting mTORC1 in meningiomas 
      and schwannomas.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate in solid organ 
      transplant recipients.
PG  - 13-58
AB  - This review aims to provide an extensive overview of the literature on the 
      clinical pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate in solid organ transplantation and a 
      briefer summary of current pharmacodynamic information. Strategies are suggested 
      for further optimisation of mycophenolate therapy and areas where additional 
      research is warranted are highlighted. Mycophenolate has gained widespread 
      acceptance as the antimetabolite immunosuppressant of choice in organ transplant 
      regimens. Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active drug moiety. Currently, two 
      mycophenolate compounds are available, mycophenolate mofetil and enteric-coated 
      (EC) mycophenolate sodium. MPA is a potent, selective and reversible inhibitor of 
      inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), leading to eventual arrest of T- and 
      B-lymphocyte proliferation. Mycophenolate mofetil and EC-mycophenolate sodium are 
      essentially completely hydrolysed to MPA by esterases in the gut wall, blood, 
      liver and tissue. Oral bioavailability of MPA, subsequent to mycophenolate 
      mofetil administration, ranges from 80.7% to 94%. EC-mycophenolate sodium has an 
      absolute bioavailability of MPA of approximately 72%. MPA binds 97-99% to serum 
      albumin in patients with normal renal and liver function. It is metabolised in 
      the liver, gastrointestinal tract and kidney by uridine diphosphate 
      gluconosyltransferases (UGTs). 7-O-MPA-glucuronide (MPAG) is the major metabolite 
      of MPA. MPAG is usually present in the plasma at 20- to 100-fold higher 
      concentrations than MPA, but it is not pharmacologically active. At least three 
      minor metabolites are also formed, of which an acyl-glucuronide has 
      pharmacological potency comparable to MPA. MPAG is excreted into the urine via 
      active tubular secretion and into the bile by multi-drug resistance protein 2 
      (MRP-2). MPAG is de-conjugated back to MPA by gut bacteria and then reabsorbed in 
      the colon. Mycophenolate mofetil and EC-mycophenolate sodium display linear 
      pharmacokinetics. Following mycophenolate mofetil administration, MPA maximum 
      concentration usually occurs in 1-2 hours. EC-mycophenolate sodium exhibits a 
      median lag time in absorption of MPA from 0.25 to 1.25 hours. A secondary peak in 
      the concentration-time profile of MPA, due to enterohepatic recirculation, often 
      appears 6-12 hours after dosing. This contributes approximately 40% to the area 
      under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). The mean elimination half-life 
      of MPA ranges from 9 to 17 hours. MPA displays large between- and within-subject 
      pharmacokinetic variability. Dose-normalised MPA AUC can vary more than 10-fold. 
      Total MPA concentrations should be interpreted with caution in patients with 
      severe renal impairment, liver disease and hypoalbuminaemia. In such individuals, 
      MPA and MPAG plasma protein binding may be altered, changing the fraction of free 
      MPA available. Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of total MPA appears to increase in 
      proportion to the increased free fraction, with a reduction in total MPA AUC. 
      However, there may be little change in the MPA free concentration. Ciclosporin 
      inhibits biliary excretion of MPAG by MRP-2, reducing enterohepatic recirculation 
      of MPA. Exposure to MPA when mycophenolate mofetil is given in combination with 
      ciclosporin is approximately 30-40% lower than when given alone or with 
      tacrolimus or sirolimus. High dosages of corticosteroids may induce expression of 
      UGT, reducing exposure to MPA. Other co-medications can interfere with the 
      absorption, enterohepatic recycling and metabolism of mycophenolate. Most 
      pharmacokinetic investigations of MPA have involved mycophenolate mofetil rather 
      than EC-mycophenolate sodium therapy. In population pharmacokinetic studies, MPA 
      CL/F in adults ranges from 14.1 to 34.9 L/h (ciclosporin co-therapy) and from 
      11.9 to 25.4 L/h (tacrolimus co-therapy). Patient bodyweight, serum albumin 
      concentration and immunosuppressant co-therapy have a significant influence on 
      CL/F. The majority of pharmacodynamic data on MPA have been obtained in patients 
      receiving mycophenolate mofetil therapy in the first year after kidney 
      transplantation. Low MPA AUC is associated with increased incidence of 
      biopsy-proven acute rejection. Gastrointestinal adverse events may be dose 
      related. Leukopenia and anaemia have been associated with high MPA AUC, trough 
      concentration and metabolite concentrations in some, but not all, studies. High 
      free MPA exposure has been identified as a risk factor for leukopenia in some 
      investigations. Targeting a total MPA AUC from 0 to 12 hours (AUC12) of 30-60 
      mg.hr/L is likely to minimise the risk of acute rejection and may reduce 
      toxicity. IMPDH monitoring is in the early experimental stage. Individualisation 
      of mycophenolate therapy should lead to improved patient outcomes. MPA AUC12 
      appears to be the most useful exposure measure for such individualisation. 
      Limited sampling strategies and Bayesian forecasting are practical means of 
      estimating MPA AUC12 without full concentration-time profiling. Target 
      concentration intervention may be particularly useful in the first few months 
      post-transplant and prior to major changes in anti-rejection therapy. In patients 
      with impaired renal or hepatic function or hypoalbuminaemia, free drug 
      measurement could be valuable in further interpretation of MPA exposure.

      gastric cancer patients.
PG  - 1580-6
LID - 10.1007/s10637-013-0022-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of 
      combination regimen of capecitabine plus everolimus in patients with refractory 
      gastric cancer who have failed to at least two cytotoxic regimens. METHODS: 
      Patients received capecitabine 650 mg/m(2) twice daily (D1-14) and everolimus 5 
      mg twice daily (D1-21) every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable 
      toxicity. The primary endpoint of the study was overall response (partial or 
      complete response) and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival 
      (time between registration and disease progression or death) and overall 
      survival. Pharmacokinetic analysis was also performed. Patients who have failed 
      to at least two cytotoxic regimens were enrolled. RESULTS: Between March 2010 and 
      June 2012, 47 patients were enrolled. 33 patients (70.2%) had received more than 
      three previous regimens prior to enrolment. Among 43 evaluable patients for 
      treatment response, 5 patients achieved confirmed partial response and 18 
      patients showed stable disease, resulting in an overall response rate (ORR) of 
      10.6% (95% C.I.: 1.8-19.4%) and disease control rate of 48.9% (95% 
      C.I.:34.6-63.2%). At a median follow-up of 106 weeks (range, 21-141 weeks), the 
      median progression-free survival and overall survival were 11.0 weeks (95% C.I.: 
      5.7-16.3 weeks) and 21.0 weeks (95% C.I.: 14.3-27.7 weeks), respectively. Grade 3 
      nausea, diarrhea and stomatitis occurred in two, three and three patients, 
      respectively. Elevated liver enzyme was observed in 21 patients and no patient 
      had pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of capecitabine 650 mg/m(2) 
      twice daily and everolimus 5 mg twice daily was found to be effective in a small 
      subset of GC patients who were heavily pre-treated.

TI  - Prediction of Free from Total Mycophenolic Acid Concentrations in Stable Renal 
      Transplant Patients: A Population-Based Approach.
PG  - 877-893
LID - 10.1007/s40262-017-0603-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A population pharmacokinetic (PK) protein-binding model was developed 
      to (1) predict free mycophenolic acid (fMPA) based on total MPA (tMPA) 
      concentrations in renal transplant patients, to establish the therapeutic range 
      of fMPA through pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies; and (2) provide a 
      guideline for dosing mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). METHODS: Full PK profiles of 56 
      patients (from five different occasions) during the first year after 
      transplantation who were treated with oral MMF and cyclosporine, or macrolides 
      (either tacrolimus or sirolimus), were analysed. fMPA protein-binding was 
      modelled using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM). The influence of 
      physiological factors and coadministered immunosupressant was studied. RESULTS: A 
      two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination, linear protein 
      binding and enterohepatic circulation (EHC) best described the PK of MPA. 
      Different recycling rate constants were considered depending on the 
      coadministered immunosuppressant. The protein-binding rate constant (K(B) 
      [relative standard error, RSE%]) increased nonlinearly with renal function 
      according to K (B) = 43.1 (3.13)·(CL(CR)/59.51)(0.394(10.66)) h(-1). Furthermore, 
      fMPA plasma clearance, given by clearance of the free mycophenolic acid 
      (CL(fMPA)), CL(fMPA) = 410 (RSE%3.00)·(1+CsA·0.594 (22.39)) L/h, was 59.4% 
      greater in cyclosporine-treated patients than in macrolide-treated patients, 
      leading to lower MPA exposures. External evaluation proved acceptable area under 
      the plasma concentration-time curve and trough concentration predictions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A reliable protein-binding population PK model was developed for 
      prediction of fMPA or tMPA from each other and for dose guiding in stable renal 
      transplant recipients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant used in solid organ 
      transplantation. Due to variable individual pharmacokinetics and narrow 
      therapeutic ranges, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is critical to the success 
      of post-transplantation patient care. We developed a rapid method quantifying 
      whole blood sirolimus using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS) with an automated online extraction technology. METHODS: Whole blood 
      (100 microL) was mixed with a precipitation solution containing internal standard 
      (32-desmethoxyrapamycin) and centrifuged at 15,634 x g for 10 min. The 
      supernatant (50 microL) was injected onto a turbulent flow preparatory column and 
      then a C18 analytical column. The mass spectrometer was set for positive 
      electrospray to monitor the ammonium adducts. RESULTS: Analytical time was 4 
      min/injection. Inter- and intra-assay variation coefficients across three 
      concentration levels ranged from 2.3% to 7.4%. The method was linear from 1.0 to 
      100.0 ng/mL with an accuracy of 93.3%-100.0%. No carryover was detected from 
      samples at 313.6 ng/mL. There was no obvious ion suppression from patient samples 
      or interference from other commonly used immunosuppressants. Good correlation 
      with an in-house commercial LC-MS was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The LC-MS/MS method 
      coupled with turbulent flow technology is rapid and efficient in TDM of whole 
      blood sirolimus.

AB  - Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method has proved to 
      powerful research tool due to its sensitivity, high selectivity, and high 
      throughput efficiency..Sirolimus was extracted from plasma by two-step extraction 
      procedure using chloroform as extracting solvent. Signal intensity was high using 
      ESI(+) source provided for the quantitation of samples. Chromatographic 
      separation was performed on phenomenax C-18 column (250 x 4.60 mm 
      5microns).Mobile phase contains acetonitrile, water (80; 20 v/v) + 0.1% acetic 
      acid, flow rate 1 mL/min.The retention time of Sirolimus 8.4 min, the total run 
      time10 min. Linearity correlation coefficients (r(2)) curve was 
      0.997183.calibraction range 10-1000 ng/mL. The UV detection of Sirolimus was at 
      278(277.78) nm. Sirolimus coated drug eluting stents, MRM (Multiple reaction 
      monitoring) transition of Sirolimus m/z 936.83-208.84 was selected to obtain 
      maximum sensitivity. LC/MS/MS results exhibited consistency in drug content on 
      the stent surface. In-vitro release kinetic indicated the release of Sirolimus in 
      41 days from the date of implanted. Drug release was found at the first day, 
      burst release was observed at 7(th) day of implantation. This study involved 
      pharmacological coating of stents, based on the notion that sustained systemic 
      local delivery of anti-proliferative agents. LC-MS/MS method has been 
      successfully used in the pharmacokinetic analysis of Sirolimus coated drug 
      eluting stents.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus in children.
PG  - 138-42
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31816ba73a [doi]
AB  - This review summarizes the pharmacokinetics in children and youths of 2 commonly 
      used immunosuppressive drugs, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and sirolimus (Sir), as 
      presented at the IATDMCT 2007 conference. The review focuses on the developmental 
      changes of drug disposition during childhood and adolescence. Regarding 
      mycophenolate mofetil, the authors were unable to demonstrate age dependency of 
      MMF in combination with cyclosporine. By contrast, there was an inverse 
      relationship between age and the dose-normalized mycophenolate (MPA) 
      area-under-the-time-concentration curve (AUC) in children who received 
      concomitant tacrolimus (Tac). Dose-normalized MPA AUCs were higher than commonly 
      observed in adult patients. It can be hypothesized that the age dependency is 
      related to developmental changes in the expression of the 
      UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. Sirolimus half-life and mean residence time (MRT) 
      are shorter than in adults. Similar to that in adults, there is a profound 
      drug-drug interaction between cyclosporine and Sir. In our own experience, Sir 
      was started at 0.13 +/- 0.05 mg/kg/day. The average Sir AUC was 64.9 +/- 29.7 
      ng*h/mL. The median (range) AUC for each metabolite was as follows: 
      12-hydroxy-Sir, 7.6 (0.2-18.8); 46-hydroxy-Sir, 3.1 (0.0-12.4); 24-hydroxy-Sir, 
      4.3 (0.0-12.6); piperidine-hydroxy-Sir, 3.5 (0.0-8.3); 39-desmethyl-Sir, 3.6 
      (0.0-11.3); 16-desmethyl-Sir, 5.0 (0.1-9.9); and di-hydroxy-Sir, 4.3 (0.0-32.5) 
      ng*h/mL. Of the total metabolite AUC, 77.5% was due to hydroxylated metabolites, 
      while 39-O-desmethyl Sir (the main metabolite in adults) comprised only 8.4% of 
      the metabolites. This is clinically relevant, as 39-O-desmethyl Sir shows 86% to 
      127% cross-reactivity with the Sir immunoassay. Metabolites reached a median AUC 
      of 60% of that of Sir, but the range was 2.6% to 136%. The age dependency of Sir 
      metabolite formation was confirmed in a human liver microsome model. On the basis 
      of the age dependency of piperidine-hydroxy Sir, the authors postulate that the 
      ontogeny of the drug disposition can be largely explained by developmental 
      changes of the CYP2C8 expression. In conclusion, both Sir and MMF drug 
      disposition vary in children and adolescents from adult patients, most likely 
      because of developmental changes of biliary transporters and metabolic enzymes.

TI  - Everolimus with reduced cyclosporine versus MMF with standard cyclosporine in de 
      novo heart transplant recipients.
PG  - 115-22
LID - 10.1097/TP.0b013e3181aacd22 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacokinetic modeling supports trough monitoring of everolimus, 
      but prospective data comparing this approach versus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 
      in de novo cardiac transplant recipients are currently unavailable. METHODS: In a 
      12-month multicenter open-label study, cardiac transplant patients received 
      everolimus (trough level 3-8 ng/mL) with reduced cyclosporine A (CsA) or MMF (3 
      g/day) with standard CsA, both with corticosteroids+/-induction therapy. RESULTS: 
      In total, 176 patients were randomized (everolimus 92, MMF 84). Mean creatinine 
      clearance was 72.5+/-27.9 and 76.8+/-32.1 mL/min at baseline, 65.4+/-24.7 and 
      72.2+/-26.2 mL/min at month 6, and 68.7+/-27.7 and 71.8+/-29.8 mL/min at month 12 
      with everolimus and MMF, respectively. The primary endpoint was not met since 
      calculated CrCl at month 6 posttransplant was 6.9 mL/min lower with everolimus, 
      exceeding the predefined margin of 6 mL/min. However, by month 12 the 
      between-group difference had narrowed versus baseline (3.1 mL/min). All efficacy 
      endpoints were noninferior for everolimus versus MMF. The 12-month incidence of 
      biopsy-proven acute rejection International Heart and Lung Transplantation grade 
      more than or equal to 3A was 21 of 92 (22.8%) with everolimus and 25 of 84 
      (29.8%) with MMF. Adverse events were consistent with class effects including 
      less-frequent cytomegalovirus infection with everolimus (4 [4.4%]) than MMF (14 
      [16.9%], P=0.01). CONCLUSION: Concentration-controlled everolimus with reduced 
      CsA results in similar renal function and equivalent efficacy compared with MMF 
      with standard CsA at 12 months after cardiac transplantation.

TI  - P-glycoprotein, CYP3A, and plasma carboxylesterase determine brain and blood 
      disposition of the mTOR Inhibitor everolimus (Afinitor) in mice.

AB  - PURPOSE: To clarify the role of ABCB1, ABCG2, and CYP3A in blood and brain 
      exposure of everolimus using knockout mouse models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used 
      wild-type, Abcb1a/1b(-/-), Abcg2(-/-), Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2(-/-), and Cyp3a(-/-) mice 
      to study everolimus oral bioavailability and brain accumulation. RESULTS: 
      Following everolimus administration, brain concentrations and brain-to-liver 
      ratios were substantially increased in Abcb1a/1b(-/-)and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2(-/-), 
      but not Abcg2(-/-)mice. The fraction of everolimus located in the plasma 
      compartment was highly increased in all knockout strains. In vitro, everolimus 
      was rapidly degraded in wild-type but not knockout plasma. Carboxylesterase 1c 
      (Ces1c), a plasma carboxylesterase gene, was highly upregulated (∼80-fold) in the 
      liver of knockout mice relative to wild-type mice, and plasma Ces1c likely 
      protected everolimus from degradation by binding and stabilizing it. This binding 
      was prevented by preincubation with the carboxylesterase inhibitor BNPP. In vivo 
      knockdown experiments confirmed the involvement of Ces1c in everolimus 
      stabilization. Everolimus also markedly inhibited the hydrolysis of irinotecan 
      and p-nitrophenyl acetate by mouse plasma carboxylesterase and recombinant human 
      CES2, respectively. After correcting for carboxylesterase binding, Cyp3a(-/-), 
      but not Abcb1a/1b(-/-), Abcg2(-/-), or Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2(-/-)mice, displayed highly 
      (>5-fold) increased oral availability of everolimus. CONCLUSIONS: Brain 
      accumulation of everolimus was restricted by Abcb1, but not Abcg2, suggesting the 
      use of coadministered ABCB1 inhibitors to improve brain tumor treatment. Cyp3a, 
      but not Abcb1a/1b, restricted everolimus oral availability, underscoring 
      drug-drug interaction risks via CYP3A. Upregulated Ces1c likely mediated the 
      tight binding and stabilization of everolimus, causing higher plasma retention in 
      knockout strains. This Ces upregulation might confound other pharmacologic 
      studies.

AB  - The objective of this study was to develop an oral formulation that would improve 
      the solubility and oral absorption of sirolimus using a TPGS micellar solution. 
      The effect of TPGS on the solubility and stability of sirolimus was evaluated. 
      The sirolimus-loaded TPGS micelles were prepared using the thin-film hydration 
      method. The average size of the sirolimus-loaded TPGS micelles was 11 nm. The 
      concentration of sirolimus in a 50 mg/mL TPGS micellar solution was 0.97 ± 0.12 
      mg/mL, which demonstrates an enhancement of approximately 400-fold from the 
      solubility of sirolimus in water. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic studies in rats 
      indicated that the TPGS micellar solution significantly improved the oral 
      absorption of sirolimus. Therefore, the preliminary results from this study 
      suggest that a TPGS micellar solution has great potential for clinical 
      applications.

TI  - Simulation of sirolimus exposures and population variability immediately post 
      renal transplantation: importance of the patient's CYP3A5 genotype in tailoring 
      treatment.
PG  - 129-37
LID - 10.1002/bdd.697 [doi]
AB  - The rapid achievement of efficacious exposure to sirolimus (SRL) after renal 
      transplantation is crucial. However, there is high unpredictability in the dose 
      to exposure relationship. Part of the variation is related to patients 
      originating from subpopulations of fast or slow metabolizers via the CYP3A5*1/*3 
      genotype. The probability of achieving therapeutic SRL blood concentrations for 
      each subpopulation under two equal-intensity increasing-frequency protocols after 
      the start of treatment was explored with Monte Carlo simulation. The population 
      pharmacokinetic model and inter-patient variability distributions of Djebli et 
      al. (DRH2006) were sampled. They developed a base and final model with a genotype 
      covariate for CL/F in patients receiving calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-free therapy 
      with SRL, mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids. Fast metabolizers 
      (expressers) had a CL/F of 28.3 l/h whilst slow metabolizers (non-expressers) had 
      a CL/F of 14.1 l/h. Here, in simulation, a standard 10 mg QD SRL was contrasted 
      with a higher frequency of 5 mg BID SRL as related to the proportion of next 
      dosed patients being within the 15-30 ng/ml trough levels on day 7 after 
      transplantation. Near 0% of expressers on either regimen reached or exceeded the 
      30 ng/ml trough on day 7. Expressers showed protocol dependence for the chance of 
      being within the 15-30 ng/ml range with the 5 mg BID protocol doubling those 
      chances. Non-expressers appeared less protocol dependent for the probability of 
      being above or below the 15-30 ng/ml range. The ability to determine the genotype 
      early on may help to rationalize the initial titration of individual patients 
      receiving CNI-free renal transplantation treatment with SRL.

AB  - Everolimus (EVR) is often administered with cyclosporine A (CsA), according to an 
      established protocol. Although the administration protocol of EVR with tacrolimus 
      (TAC) has not been established, it has been clinically demonstrated that a higher 
      dose of EVR is necessary when used in combination with TAC than with CsA. In this 
      study, we aimed to determine the optimal dose of EVR administered with TAC to 
      maintain a similar EVR level in the blood to that observed when EVR is 
      administered with CsA. Between June 2009 and January 2016, 22 patients who 
      underwent living donor kidney transplantation were enrolled in this study. Among 
      them, 12 patients were administered steroids, basiliximab, CsA, and EVR 
      (CsA + EVR group) and 10 were administered steroids, basiliximab, TAC, and EVR 
      (TAC + EVR group). Blood samples were collected at different time points from 
      patients in both CsA + EVR and TAC + EVR groups, after drug administration. The 
      trough EVR level in both groups was maintained within 3-8 ng/mL during the 
      perioperative period. The optimal EVR doses for both groups were estimated by 
      using a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Overall, the optimal dose of EVR for 
      the TAC + EVR group was 3.59-fold higher than that for the CsA + EVR group to 
      maintain a similar trough level to that of the latter group. Thus, administration 
      of a higher EVR dose is recommended when provided in combination with TAC than 
      with CsA to prevent adverse events caused by under immunosuppression, that could 
      lead to acute kidney rejection.

TI  - Molecular Targeting of Immunosuppressants Using a Bifunctional Elastin-Like 
      Polypeptide.
PG  - 2358-2372
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.9b00462 [doi]
AB  - Elastin-Like Polypeptides (ELP) are environmentally responsive protein polymers 
      which are easy to engineer and biocompatible, making them ideal candidates as 
      drug carriers. Our team has recently utilized ELPs fused to FKBP12 to carry 
      Rapamycin (Rapa), a potent immunosuppressant. Through high affinity binding to 
      Rapa, FKBP carriers can yield beneficial therapeutic effects and reduce the 
      off-site toxicity of Rapa. Since ICAM-1 is significantly elevated at sites of 
      inflammation in diverse diseases, we hypothesized that a molecularly targeted ELP 
      carrier capable of binding ICAM-1 might have advantageous properties. Here we 
      report on the design, characterization, pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution of 
      a new ICAM-1-targeted ELP Rapa carrier (IBPAF) and its preliminary 
      characterization in a murine model exhibiting elevated ICAM-1. Lacrimal glands 
      (LG) of male NOD mice, a disease model recapitulating the autoimmune 
      dacryoadenitis seen in Sjögren's Syndrome patients, were analyzed to confirm that 
      ICAM-1 was significantly elevated in the LG relative to control male BALB/c mice 
      (3.5-fold, p < 0.05, n = 6). In vitro studies showed that IBPAF had significantly 
      higher binding to TNF-α-stimulated bEnd.3 cells which overexpress surface ICAM-1, 
      relative to nontargeted control ELP (AF)(4.0-fold, p < 0.05). A pharmacokinetics 
      study in male NOD mice showed no significant differences between AF and IBPAF for 
      plasma half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution. However, both constructs 
      maintained a higher level of Rapa in systemic circulation compared to free Rapa. 
      Interestingly, in the male NOD mouse, the accumulation of IBPAF was significantly 
      higher in homogenized LG extracts compared to AF at 2 h (8.6 ± 6.6% versus 1.3 ± 
      1.3%, respectively, n = 5, p < 0.05). This accumulation was transient with no 
      differences detected at 8 or 24 h. This study describes the first ICAM-1 targeted 
      protein-polymer carrier for Rapa that specifically binds to ICAM-1 in vitro and 
      accumulates in ICAM-1 overexpressing tissue in vivo, which may be useful for 
      molecular targeting in diverse inflammatory diseases where ICAM-1 is elevated.

TI  - Synergistic mechanisms by which sirolimus and cyclosporin inhibit rat heart and 
      kidney allograft rejection.
PG  - 63-8
AB  - The studies presented herein examined the mechanism(s) whereby sirolimus (SRL) 
      and cyclosporin (CsA) act synergistically to block allograft rejection. 
      Combination index (CI = 1 reflects additive, CI > 1 antagonistic, and CI < 1 
      synergistic, effects) analysis documented potent synergism between SRL and CsA to 
      block allograft rejection. Combinations of the two drugs produced synergistic 
      prolongation of heart (CI = 0.001-0.2) or kidney (CI = 0.03-0.5) allograft 
      survival at SRL/CsA ratios ranging from 1:12.5 to 1:200. Pharmacokinetic analysis 
      of the individual drugs showed that CsA does not affect the blood levels of SRL, 
      and SRL mildly increases the levels of CsA in SRL/CsA-treated rats. Quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to document that both subtherapeutic 
      (1.0 mg/kg) and therapeutic (2.0 or 4.0 mg/kg) CsA doses inhibited the expression 
      of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (P < 0.03) and IL-2 (P < 0.003) mRNA produced by 
      T helper (Th) 1 cells, as well as IL-10 (P < 0.001), but not IL-4 (NS) mRNA 
      produced by Th2 cells. Contrariwise, all tested SRL doses (0.02, 0.04 or 0.08 
      mg/kg) did not affect cytokine mRNA expression. However, heart allografts from 
      rat recipients treated with synergistic SRL/CsA doses displayed reduced levels of 
      IFN-gamma (P < 0.01), IL-2 (P < 0.001) and IL-10 (P < 0.001) mRNA. Thus, because 
      subtherapeutic doses of CsA reduce Th1/Th2 activity, thereby facilitating the 
      inhibition of signal transduction by low does of SRL, the two agents act 
      synergistically to inhibit allograft rejection.

TI  - Determination of the pharmacokinetics of cerivastatin when administered in 
      combination with sirolimus and cyclosporin A in patients with kidney transplant, 
      and review of the relevant literature.
PG  - 499-503
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Therapy of elevated cholesterol serum concentrations is often 
      necessary in patients with kidney transplants. However, the pharmacokinetics of 
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors when administered in combination with sirolimus and 
      cyclosporin A (CsA) have not been determined. The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the pharmacokinetics of cerivastatin when administered in combination 
      with sirolimus in patients with kidney transplants, and to review the literature 
      with regard to the differences in pharmacological behavior between sirolimus, CsA 
      and tacrolimus. METHODS: Patients (n = 7) with a stable and functioning kidney 
      transplant and elevated LDL cholesterol serum concentrations were included in the 
      study. After an observation period of 3 months, and whilst receiving sirolimus 
      and CsA, cerivastatin (0.2 mg daily) was administered for a period of 3 months. 
      Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated on Day 1 and 3 months after initiation 
      of cerivastatin therapy. Routine laboratory parameters and clinical adverse 
      events were monitored throughout the study period. RESULTS: Single-dose 
      cerivastatin AUC was 2 to 3-fold higher in comparison to published values 
      obtained in healthy subjects. The accumulation ratio of cerivastatin (after 3 
      months/ Day 1) was 1.6. Sirolimus and CsA trough levels, and the sirolimus AUC 
      did not differ after single dose and multiple doses of cerivastatin. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The combination therapy of cerivastatin with sirolimus and CsA leads to a 
      significant increase in cerivastatin exposure. Additional drug monitoring of 
      sirolimus and CsA is not necessary.

TI  - Therapeutic drug monitoring of sirolimus: correlations with efficacy and 
      toxicity.
PG  - 97-109
AB  - We sought to examine the potential benefits of therapeutic drug monitoring of 
      sirolimus, a potent immunosuppressive agent that displays a pleiotropic array of 
      side effects. METHODS: A high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) procedure 
      combined with ultraviolet detection (UV) was used to measure serial 
      concentrations of parent compound sirolimus in 150 renal transplant recipients 
      over a period of 4 yr. Drug concentrations in whole blood at trough time, as well 
      as within pharmacokinetic profiles, were correlated with clinical events using 
      contingency tables, logistic regression analysis, and receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The LC/UV method showed an excellent 
      correlation with detection of LC-resolved components by tandem mass spectrometry, 
      demonstrating that the LC/UV method selectively detected parent compound. 
      Sirolimus displayed the characteristics of a critical-dose drug: Its 
      concentration could not be predicted by a standard body or demographic measure, 
      or by dose, and it showed high degrees of intra- and inter-individual 
      variability. However, there was a good correlation between trough and 
      area-under-the-curve measurements. There was a significant association between 
      trough values expressed as either observed ( < 5 ng/mL) or dose-corrected 
      parameter ( < 1.7 ng/mL per mg administered drug) and the occurrence and severity 
      of acute rejection episodes - despite the low overall incidence of 23 episodes 
      among the cohort of 150 patients. Similarly, ROC functions showed a correlation 
      of the occurrence of hypertriglyceridemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, but 
      not hypercholesterolemia, with trough concentrations above 15 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: 
      Due to its behavior as a critical-dose drug, therapeutic monitoring to measure 
      sirolimus concentrations by a LC/UV method may provide clinicians with a tool to 
      optimize outcomes.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of prednisolone and prednisone in 
      solid organ transplantation.
PG  - 711-41

AB  - Prednisolone and prednisone are integral components of induction and maintenance 
      immunosuppressive regimens in solid organ transplantation. The pharmacokinetics 
      of these agents are extremely complex. Prednisolone is the active drug moiety 
      while prednisone is both a pro-drug and inactive metabolite of prednisolone. 
      Within the dosage range used in transplantation, prednisolone and prednisone 
      exhibit concentration-dependent non-linear pharmacokinetics when parameters are 
      measured with reference to total drug concentration. Dose dependency disappears 
      when free (unbound) prednisolone is measured. Altered organ function, changing 
      biochemistry and use of a number of concomitant medicines in transplantation 
      appear to lead to pharmacokinetic differences in transplant recipients compared 
      with other patient groups. Greater than threefold variability in dose-adjusted 
      exposure to total prednisolone in transplant recipients is evident. Time 
      post-transplant, hepatic and renal dysfunction, patient age, sex, bodyweight, 
      serum albumin concentration, concomitant medication exposure, various disease 
      states and genetic polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes and drug transporters have 
      sometimes been associated with prednisolone pharmacokinetic variability. The 
      clinical impact of corticosteroid therapy on the disposition of ciclosporin, 
      tacrolimus and sirolimus and the impact of different immunosuppressant therapy 
      combinations on prednisolone exposure needs to be further elucidated. Patient 
      response patterns to prednisolone are consistent with delayed and indirect 
      mechanisms of corticosteroid action involving modification of nuclear 
      transcription and protein synthesis. Many adverse effects have been linked with 
      prednisolone and prednisone therapy, but not all of these have been investigated 
      thoroughly in transplant populations. Dyslipidaemia, growth restriction, 
      diabetogenesis, hypertension and cataracts are well studied toxicities. Evidence 
      is less clear for prednisolone-induced osteonecrosis, obesity and 
      hypertriglyceridaemia. There have been some reports of a relationship between 
      prednisolone pharmacokinetics and incidence of acute rejection, Cushing's 
      syndrome and adverse cardiovascular and metabolic events. Dosing of prednisolone 
      and prednisone in transplantation is typically empirical and varies significantly 
      across transplant centres. Currently, authoritative guidelines are conflicting in 
      their opinions regarding corticosteroid avoidance and early discontinuation in 
      adult kidney transplantation. Overall, data suggest the promise of 
      corticosteroid-free immunosuppression in paediatric patients. Further 
      investigation of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of prednisolone and 
      prednisone in transplant recipients based on new chromatography assay techniques 
      and free drug measurement, population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling 
      approaches, genetic testing and larger studies in patients on modern day 
      immunosuppressant protocols may lead to better individualization of 
      corticosteroid therapy in the future.

TI  - Preclinical evaluation of second-generation everolimus- and zotarolimus-eluting 
      coronary stents.
PG  - 383-90
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and vascular 
      healing of a second-generation everolimus-eluting stent (EES) and slow-release 
      zotarolimus-eluting stent (R-ZES). BACKGROUND: Second-generation DESs have 
      alleviated the safety concerns of late stent thrombosis by addressing issues of 
      polymer biocompatibility and stent design, and optimizing drug loads and release 
      kinetics. No preclinical comparison study exists between these stents. METHODS: 
      Rabbit iliac artery stent implantation was performed using Xience Prime EES and 
      Resolute R-ZES. Histomorphometric evaluation was performed at 28 and 60 days 
      after implantation in an induced atheroma model. Endothelial coverage and 
      maturation were assessed by scanning electron microscopy and immuno-labeling at 
      14 and 28 days following deployment. For pharmacokinetic studies, arterial tissue 
      and stents were retrieved at 3, 14, 28, and 90 days, and blood samples were 
      obtained during the first 24 hours. RESULTS: Vascular remodeling (percent 
      stenosis, neointimal thickness) was similar in arteries implanted with either 
      stent group. At 28 days, inflammation was significantly less in the EES group as 
      compared to the R-ZES group (inflammation score: 1.59 ± 0.52 vs 2.22 ± 0.69, 
      respectively; P=.044), with no differences observed at 60 days. Endothelial 
      coverage was similar between both groups; however, endothelial maturation above 
      stent struts was significantly higher in the EES group vs R-ZES group at 28 days 
      (33 ± 20% vs 22 ± 21%, respectively; P=.040). Arterial drug level concentrations 
      were also shown to be significantly less in the EES group vs the R-ZES group 
      (P<.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, EES and R-ZES displayed similar remodeling 
      properties with lower arterial drug levels observed in the EES group vs the R-ZES 
      group, which may have led to more rapid endothelial maturation.

TI  - Prolonged activity and toxicity of sirolimus in a patient with metastatic renal 
      perivascular epithelioid cell tumor: a case report and literature review.
PG  - 589-595
LID - 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000634 [doi]
AB  - Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) is a family of mesenchymal tumors. 
      Conventional chemotherapy has little activity in this disease, but case reports 
      are available on the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (e.g. 
      sirolimus and temsirolimus). Pharmacokinetic assays of sirolimus are available as 
      this drug has a precise therapeutic window and blood levels might be influenced 
      by CYP3A4 polymorphisms and drug interactions. We report on a case of a patient 
      with metastatic, progressive PEComa who started sirolimus at a dose of 5 mg/day 
      with evidence of grade (G) 3 mucositis, G2 thrombocytopenia, and G1 leucopenia 10 
      days after the treatment started, in absence of concomitant medications or 
      prohibited food assumption. Elevated sirolimus blood levels were detected 
      (156.8 ng/ml). Sirolimus was stopped, and toxicity resolved in 5 weeks. Computed 
      tomography scan 2 months after the treatment started showed a partial response 
      (RECIST). After toxicity resolution, the patient restarted sirolimus at a dose of 
      1 mg/day, with blood levels in the range of 10-20 ng/ml. Tumor response was 
      confirmed and maintained, and the patient is still under treatment 18 months 
      later, with no additional adverse effects. Genetic analysis of five selected 
      polymorphisms (rs2740574, rs776746, rs1128503, rs2032582, and rs1045642) in drug 
      metabolism enzymes and transporters did not provide a clear explanation of the 
      observed unusual pharmacokinetic. This case confirms the activity of mammalian 
      target of rapamycin inhibitors in PEComa and strengthens the importance of 
      pharmacokinetic drug blood levels monitoring in patients treated with sirolimus. 
      In our patient, after dose adjustment, sirolimus could be restarted with a 
      prolonged clinical benefit and no additional toxicity.

TI  - A comparative, randomized trial of concentration-controlled sirolimus combined 
      with reduced-dose tacrolimus or standard-dose tacrolimus in renal allograft 
      recipients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical safety and efficacy of sirolimus plus reduced-dose 
      tacrolimus was evaluated in de novo renal allograft recipients enrolled in a 
      comparative, open-label study. METHODS: One hundred twenty-eight renal allograft 
      recipients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive reduced-dose tacrolimus plus 
      sirolimus (rTAC) or standard-dose tacrolimus and sirolimus (sTAC) for 6 months. 
      The primary efficacy endpoint was calculated creatinine clearance values at 6 
      months. RESULTS: Demographic variables were similar between groups. At 6 months, 
      mean (± standard deviation) calculated creatinine clearance was significantly 
      improved in the rTAC group (63.8 vs 52.7 mL/min, P = .005), although mean serum 
      creatinine values were not significantly different. Patient survival (95.2% and 
      96.9%) and graft survival (93.7% and 98.5%) were similar between the rTAC and 
      sTAC groups, respectively. Acute rejection rates were 17.5% with rTAC and 7.7% 
      with sTAC (P = .095). CONCLUSIONS: The rTAC regimen provided effective 
      immunosuppression and was associated with improved creatinine clearance. Adequate 
      immunosuppressant exposure must be achieved in the early postoperative period to 
      minimize the risk of acute rejection.

TI  - Rapamycin with antiretroviral therapy in AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma: an AIDS 
      Malignancy Consortium study.
PG  - 447-54
LID - 10.1097/QAI.0b013e31823e7884 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The mammalian target of rapamycin is activated in Kaposi sarcoma (KS) 
      and its inhibitor, rapamycin, has induced KS regression in transplant-associated 
      KS. This study aimed to evaluate rapamycin's safety and toxicity in HIV-infected 
      individuals with KS receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), investigate rapamycin 
      interactions with both protease inhibitor (PI)-containing and nonnucleoside 
      reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-containing ART regimens, and assess 
      clinical and biological endpoints including KS response and mammalian target of 
      rapamycin-dependent signaling. METHODS: Seven participants, 4 on PI-based and 3 
      on NNRTI-based ART, had rapamycin titrated to achieve trough concentrations of 
      5-10 ng/mL. Patients were monitored for safety and KS response. KS biopsies were 
      evaluated for changes in phosphoribosomal S6 protein, and phospho-Akt expression. 
      Interleukin 6 and vascular endothelial growth factor levels, HIV and 
      KS-associated herpesvirus viral loads, and CD4 counts were monitored. RESULTS: 
      Despite pharmacokinetic interactions resulting in >200-fold differences in 
      cumulative weekly rapamycin doses between participants on PI-containing and 
      NNRTI-containing regimens, treatment was well tolerated. There were no 
      significant changes in viral loads or cytokine levels; modest initial decreases 
      in CD4 counts occurred in some patients. Three participants, all on PI-containing 
      regimens and with higher rapamycin exposure, showed partial KS responses. Three 
      of 4 subjects whose biopsies were studied at ≥day 50 showed decreased 
      phosphoribosomal S6 protein staining. CONCLUSIONS: Rapamycin seems safe in 
      HIV-infected individuals with KS and can, in some cases, induce tumor regression 
      and affect its molecular targets. Significant pharmacokinetic interactions 
      require careful titration to achieve target drug trough concentrations but may be 
      exploited to achieve therapeutic benefit.

AB  - AIM: This novel multiparameter Phase I study aimed to optimize doses/dosing 
      schedules of everolimus and sorafenib drug combination, based on 
      modeling/simulation (NCT01932177). PATIENTS & METHODS: About 26 patients with 
      solid tumors were treated in four different dosing schedules. Everolimus once 
      daily + sorafenib twice daily were given continuously in arms A and B, and 
      intermittently in arms C (alternating every other week) and D (everolimus 
      continuous and sorafenib 3 days on/4 days off). RESULTS: Continuous schedules 
      exhibited higher toxicity risks than intermittent schedules (64.1 vs 35.9%; p < 
      0.0001), and trends for lower disease control rates (80 vs 100%). No significant 
      pharmacokinetic interaction was identified. CONCLUSION: Feasibility of EVESOR 
      trial is demonstrated. Intermittent schedules might provide better tolerance and 
      efficacy than continuous schedules.

TI  - In vivo delivery and long-term tissue retention of nano-encapsulated sirolimus 
      using a novel porous balloon angioplasty system.
PG  - 740-7
LID - 20150205-07 [pii]
LID - 10.4244/EIJY15M10_01 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Among antirestenotic compounds, sirolimus displays a superior safety 
      profile compared to paclitaxel, but its pharmacokinetic properties make it a 
      challenging therapeutic candidate for single-time delivery. Herein we evaluate 
      the feasibility of delivery, long-term retention and vascular effects of 
      sirolimus nanoparticles delivered through a novel porous angioplasty balloon in 
      normal porcine arteries and in a swine model of in-stent restenosis (ISR). 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Sirolimus nanoparticle formulation was delivered via porous 
      balloon angioplasty to 753 coronary artery segments for pharmacokinetic studies 
      and 26 segments for biological effect of sirolimus delivery in different clinical 
      scenarios (de novo [n=8], ISR [n=6] and following stent implantation [n=12]). 
      Sirolimus coronary artery concentrations were above the target therapeutic level 
      of 1 ng/mg after 26 days, and were >100-fold higher in coronary artery treatment 
      sites than in distal myocardium and remote tissues at all time points. At 28 
      days, reduction in percent stenosis in formulation-treated sites compared to 
      balloon angioplasty treatment was noted in all three clinical scenarios, with the 
      largest effect seen in the de novo study. CONCLUSIONS: Local coronary delivery of 
      sirolimus nanoparticles in the porcine model using a novel porous balloon 
      delivery system achieved therapeutic long-term intra-arterial drug levels without 
      significant systemic residual exposure.

TI  - Sample clean-up and high-performance liquid chromatographic techniques for 
      measurement of whole blood rapamycin concentrations.
PG  - 111-20
AB  - Determination of rapamycin (RAPA), a potential adjunct to cyclosporin 
      immunosuppressive therapy in solid organ transplantation, presents a challenge 
      because of the agent's unusual chemical properties. RAPA is not readily extracted 
      from biological matrices, is light-sensitive, and exists in numerous isomeric 
      forms. Using liquid-liquid extraction techniques with tert.-butyl methyl ether 
      followed by ethanol, one achieves 96% recovery of RAPA and 70% recovery of the 
      internal standard, beta-estradiol-3-methyl ether, from human whole blood. 
      Subsequent high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) utilizing two heated 
      reversed-phase C18 columns in tandem and an 85% methanol-water mobile phase with 
      ultraviolet detection at 276 nm provides measurement of RAPA from 1-ml samples of 
      human whole blood. The chromatography requires less than 40 min per sample. The 
      assay exhibits < or = 10% standard error of the mean and < or = 12% coefficient 
      of variation over the concentration range 2-100 ng/ml. The method has been tested 
      using pharmacokinetic profiles from renal transplant recipients receiving bolus 
      intravenous RAPA infusions.

TI  - More potent lipid-lowering effect by rosuvastatin compared with fluvastatin in 
      everolimus-treated renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 1266-71
LID - 10.1097/01.TP.0000443225.66960.7e [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia is a risk factor for premature cardiovascular morbidity 
      and mortality in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). Pharmacotherapy with mTOR 
      inhibitors aggravates dyslipidemia, thus necessitating lipid-lowering therapy 
      with fluvastatin, pravastatin, or atorvastatin. These agents may not sufficiently 
      lower lipid levels, and therefore, a more potent agent like rosuvastatin maybe 
      needed. METHODS: We have aimed to assess the lipid-lowering effect of 
      rosuvastatin as compared with fluvastatin in RTR receiving everolimus. Safety was 
      assessed as the pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction potential of a 
      rosuvastatin/everolimus combination in RTR. A 12-hour everolimus PK investigation 
      was performed in 12 stable RTR receiving everolimus and fluvastatin (80 mg/d). 
      Patients were then switched to rosuvastatin (20 mg/d), and a follow-up 12/24-hour 
      PK investigation of everolimus/rosuvastatin was performed after 1 month. All 
      other drugs were kept unchanged. RESULTS: In RTR already receiving fluvastatin, 
      switching to rosuvastatin further decreased LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol 
      by 30.2±12.2% (P<0.01) and 18.2±9.6% (P<0.01), respectively. Everolimus AUC0-12 
      was not affected by concomitant rosuvastatin treatment, 80.3±21.3 μg*h/L before 
      and 78.5±21.9 μg*h/L after, respectively (P=0.61). Mean rosuvastatin AUC0-24 was 
      157±61.7 ng*h/mL, approximately threefold higher than reported in the literature 
      for nontransplants. There were no adverse events, and none of the patients had or 
      developed proteinuria. CONCLUSION: Rosuvastatin showed a superior lipid-lowering 
      effect compared to fluvastatin in stable RTR receiving everolimus. The 
      combination of everolimus/rosuvastatin seems to be as safe as the 
      everolimus/fluvastatin combination.

      cyclosporine exposure in heart-transplant recipients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trough- or 2-h post-dose (C2) blood cyclosporine (CsA) concentrations 
      are used for prediction of efficacy and toxicity of CsA in transplant recipients 
      concomitantly treated with antiproliferative agents, but information on utility 
      of blood CsA levels in patients treated with proliferation signal inhibitors 
      (PSIs), such as everolimus, is sparse. Because of the inhibitory effect of PSIs 
      on the P-glycoprotein drug efflux pump present in lymphocytes, we hypothesized 
      that CsA pharmacokinetics in blood and lymphocytes were dissociated in patients 
      concomitantly treated with everolimus. METHODS: Twelve-hour pharmacokinetic 
      studies of whole-blood and intralymphocytic CsA concentrations were conducted in 
      long-term heart-transplant recipients treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) + 
      CsA (n = 8) and everolimus + CsA (n = 9). RESULTS: There was a highly significant 
      correlation between blood CsA C2 levels and blood CsA AUC(0-12) in groups of 
      patients treated with MMF or everolimus (R(2) 0.93 and 0.96, respectively; P < 
      0.001 for both). Whereas blood CsA C2 levels were closely associated with 
      lymphocyte CsA AUC(0-12) in patients treated with MMF (R(2) = 0.98), there was 
      poor correlation between whole-blood C2 and lymphocyte AUC(0-12) in patients 
      treated with everolimus (R(2) = 0.24). CONCLUSION: Standard blood CsA levels 
      accurately predict intralymphocytic exposure to CsA in patients concomitantly 
      treated with MMF but not in patients treated with everolimus.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of sirolimus in kidney transplant patients and in patients 
      with coronary artery disease undergoing angioplasty.
PG  - 177S-180S
AB  - We show the key results of our 4-year experience with sirolimus in kidney 
      transplant patients and in nontransplanted patients undergoing coronary 
      angioplasty. METHODS: Recipients of one-haplotype living-related kidney 
      allografts were randomized to receive sirolimus (2 mg/d, n = 35) or azathioprine 
      (2 mg/kg per day, n = 35). Recipients of fully mismatched living kidney 
      allografts (n = 55) received sirolimus (2 mg/day). High-risk recipients of black 
      ethnicity (n = 68) were randomized to target whole-blood trough sirolimus 
      concentrations between 8 and 12 ng/mL or 15 to 20 ng/mL. All kidney transplant 
      patients received cyclosporine and prednisone. Sirolimus/cyclosporine 
      pharmacokinetic studies were performed in 40 patients receiving 2 mg (n = 20) or 
      5 mg (n = 20) of sirolimus 7 days after transplantation. In the coronary 
      intervention study, 12 patients at high risk for in-stent restenosis received 
      sirolimus for 28 days after angioplasty. RESULTS: The incidence of 
      biopsy-confirmed acute rejection was 11.4% in recipients of one-haplotype 
      living-related kidney allografts, 16.4% in recipients of fully mismatched living 
      kidney allografts, and 15% (8 to 12 ng/mL) and 4% (15 to 20 ng/mL) in high-risk 
      recipients of black ethnicity. Cyclosporine exposure was higher after morning 
      administration compared to evening administration. There were poor correlations 
      between sirolimus and cyclosporine exposures. The 4-month follow-up angiography 
      revealed no restenosis (stenosis diameter > 50%), a late loss of 0.56 +/- 0.40 
      mm, and a loss index of 0.33 +/- 0.30. The follow-up 3D-intravascular ultrasound 
      restudy showed an in-stent relative volumetric obstruction of 9.9 +/- 5.5%. 
      Sirolimus in highly effective in preventing kidney allograft acute rejection and 
      in-stent coronary restenosis.

AB  - A novel water-soluble everolimus prodrug, glutathione-everolimus, was designed 
      and synthesized by introducing an endogenous tripeptide with an acetyl as the 
      linker. The improvement in water solubility allowed the conjugate to be developed 
      into an injectable drug. The results of biological evaluation in vitro and in 
      vivo suggested that the prodrug was more effective and long acting than 
      everolimus. Meanwhile, the pharmacokinetics study in vivo confirmed that the 
      delivery of everolimus through the injection of the prodrug can overcome the low 
      bioavailability of oral everolimus.

TI  - Everolimus combined with gefitinib in patients with metastatic 
      castration-resistant prostate cancer: Phase 1/2 results and signaling pathway 
      implications.
PG  - 3853-61
LID - 10.1002/cncr.29578 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition are 
      limited by feedback reactivation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in 
      phosphatase and tensin homolog-null tumors. Thus, this study tested the 
      combination of mTOR inhibition (everolimus) and epidermal growth factor receptor 
      inhibition (gefitinib) in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). METHODS: 
      In phase 1, 12 patients (10 with CRPC and 2 with glioblastoma) received daily 
      gefitinib (250 mg) with weekly everolimus (30, 50, or 70 mg). In phase 2, 27 CRPC 
      patients received gefitinib with everolimus (70 mg). RESULTS: Phase 1 revealed no 
      pharmacokinetic interactions and no dose-limiting toxicities. In phase 2, 18 of 
      27 patients (67%) discontinued treatment before the 12-week evaluation because of 
      progression as evidenced by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (n = 6) or 
      imaging (n = 5) or because of a grade 2 or higher toxicity (n = 7). Thirteen of 
      the 37 CRPC patients (35%) exhibited a rapidly rising PSA level after they had 
      begun treatment, and this declined upon discontinuation. Fluorodeoxyglucose 
      positron emission tomography 24 to 72 hours after the initiation of treatment 
      showed a decrease in the standardized uptake value consistent with mTOR 
      inhibition in 27 of the 33 evaluable patients (82%); there was a corresponding 
      rise in PSA in 20 of these 27 patients (74%). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of 
      gefitinib and everolimus did not result in significant antitumor activity. The 
      induction of PSA in tumors treated with mTOR inhibitors was consistent with 
      preclinical data showing that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway signaling 
      feedback inhibits the androgen receptor (AR). This clinical evidence of relief of 
      feedback inhibition promoting enhanced AR activity supports future studies 
      combining PI3K pathway inhibitors and second-generation AR inhibitors in CRPC.

TI  - A comparison of the effect of ciclosporin and sirolimus on the pharmokinetics of 
      mycophenolate in renal transplant patients.
PG  - 477-84
AB  - AIM: To compare the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid when given with either 
      ciclosporin or sirolimus, and investigate in vitro the potential effect of 
      ciclosporin, sirolimus, tacrolimus and everolimus on mycophenolic acid 
      metabolism. METHODS: In renal transplant patients given mycophenolate mofetil in 
      combination with ciclosporin (n = 19) or sirolimus (n = 12), concentration-time 
      profiles of mycophenolic acid, mycophenolic-acid-phenyl-glucuronide, 
      mycophenolic-acid-acyl-glucuronide and mycophenolic-acid-phenyl-glucoside were 
      determined at one month post-transplant. The effect of immunosuppressive drugs on 
      mycophenolic acid glucuronidation and glycosylation was investigated in vitro 
      using human liver microsomes. RESULTS: The mean mycophenolic acid AUC(0-9 h) in 
      the sirolimus group was 44.9 mg h(-1) L(-1) (95% CI: 34.7-55.1), vs. 30.5 mg 
      h(-1) L(-1) (95% CI: 25.4-35.6) in the ciclosporin group, corresponding to 
      1.5-fold dose-normalized difference (95% CI: 1.1-1.9; P < 0.05). In addition, the 
      metabolite/mycophenolic acid AUC(0-9 h) ratios were significantly higher in 
      patients cotreated with ciclosporin than with sirolimus, giving values of 
      1.8-fold (95% CI: 1.3-2.3; P = 0.0009), 2.6-fold (95% CI: 2.0-3.3; P < 0.0001) 
      and 4.3-fold (95% CI: 2.6-6.0; P = 0.0016) for 
      mycophenolic-acid-phenyl-glucuronide, mycophenolic-acid-acyl-glucuronide and 
      mycophenolic-acid-phenyl-glucoside, respectively. In vitro, none of the 
      immunosuppressive drugs tested inhibited mycophenolic acid metabolism. 
      CONCLUSION: Patients taking mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus experience a 
      higher exposure to mycophenolic acid and a lower exposure to mycophenolic acid 
      metabolites than those being treated with mycophenolate mofetil and ciclosporin. 
      This interaction is probably not caused by inhibition of mycophenolic acid 
      glucuronidation or glycosylation, but is more likely to be due to the influence 
      of ciclosporin on the excretion of mycophenolic acid metabolites into bile.

TI  - Tivozanib for the treatment of metastatic renal cancer.
PG  - 649-60
LID - 10.1586/era.13.40 [doi]
AB  - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic renal 
      cell carcinoma (RCC). Drugs such as sorafenib, sunitinib and pazopanib act on the 
      VEGF receptor pathway, but they can also inhibit other kinases, resulting in 
      off-target toxicities. Tivozanib was developed due to its potency and selectivity 
      against VEGF receptors 1-3. It has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile after oral 
      administration and a long plasma half-life. In the Phase III TIVO-1 trial, it 
      demonstrated a higher response rate and longer progression-free survival than 
      sorafenib with a better side-effect profile. It is currently awaiting approval to 
      be used in the first-line treatment of metastatic RCC. An early-phase trial has 
      also shown its tolerability at full dose when given with the mTOR inhibitor 
      temsirolimus, suggesting its potential in combination treatment. This article 
      examines tivozanib from its laboratory to clinical development, as well as its 
      relevance and future role in the treatment of RCC in the era of the tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitors.

TI  - Phase 1 trial of gefitinib plus sirolimus in adults with recurrent malignant 
      glioma.
PG  - 860-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity 
      (DLT) of gefitinib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth 
      factor receptor, plus sirolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of 
      rapamycin, among patients with recurrent malignant glioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Gefitinib and sirolimus were administered on a continuous daily dosing schedule 
      at dose levels that were escalated in successive cohorts of malignant glioma 
      patients at any recurrence who were stratified based on concurrent use of 
      CYP3A-inducing anticonvulsants [enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, (EIAED)]. 
      Pharmacokinetic and archival tumor biomarker data were also assessed. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-four patients with progressive disease after prior radiation therapy and 
      chemotherapy were enrolled, including 29 (85%) with glioblastoma multiforme and 5 
      (15%) with anaplastic glioma. The MTD was 500 mg of gefitinib plus 5 mg of 
      sirolimus for patients not on EIAEDs and 1,000 mg of gefitinib plus 10 mg of 
      sirolimus for patients on EIAEDs. DLTs included mucositis, diarrhea, rash, 
      thrombocytopenia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Gefitinib exposure was not affected 
      by sirolimus administration but was significantly lowered by concurrent EIAED 
      use. Two patients (6%) achieved a partial radiographic response, and 13 patients 
      (38%) achieved stable disease. CONCLUSION: We show that gefitinib plus sirolimus 
      can be safely coadministered on a continuous, daily dosing schedule, and 
      established the recommended dose level of these agents in combination for future 
      phase 2 clinical trials.

TI  - A comparison of measured trough levels and abbreviated AUC estimation by limited 
      sampling strategies for monitoring mycophenolic acid exposure in stable heart 
      transplant patients receiving cyclosporin A-containing and cyclosporin A-free 
      immunosuppressive regimens.
PG  - 893-905
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (NIMF) pharmacokinetics vary widely, and 
      enterohepatic recirculation of the drug and its metabolites may be altered by 
      concurrently administered immunosuppressants, including the widely used agent 
      cyclosporin A (CsA). A reliable method of achieving effective and well-tolerated 
      levels of NIMF-based immunosuppression would be of eminent interest. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study compared the use of measured mycophenolic acid (MPA) trough levels 
      (C0) and abbreviated AUC estimation by limited-sampling strategies for monitoring 
      MPA exposure in stable heart transplant recipients (>1 year after 
      transplantation) receiving a CsA-containing or CsA-free immunosuppressive 
      regimen. METHODS: The treatment groups were receiving chronic maintenance 
      immunosuppressive regimens consisting of either CsA/MMF or rapamycin (RAPA)/MMF. 
      An additional subgroup of patients was switched from the CsA-containing regimen 
      to the RAPA-containing regimen. Fasting venous blood samples were obtained before 
      dosing and at 40, 75, 120, and 240 minutes after administration of the morning 
      dose of MME The validated Emit assay was used to measure MPA plasma 
      concentrations. Dose adjustment of AUCs was performed by dividing the AUC by the 
      morning NIMF dose in grams. Cmax after administration of the morning dose was 
      determined from available MPA data points using curve-fitting analysis. The 
      increase to Cmax (Cmax-C0) was calculated, and dose adjustment was performed as 
      before. Abbreviated 12-hour MPA AUCs were estimated using a limited-sampling 
      strategy (before dosing and 30 and 120 minutes after dosing) based on 
      high-performance liquid chromatography data. Adverse events were monitored during 
      routine follow-up visits. RESULTS: The study included 47 patients receiving 
      CsA/MMF, 15 receiving RAPA/MMF, and 9 who were switched from CsA/MMF to RAPA/MME 
      The population included 55 men and 7 women, with a mean age of 58.94 years and a 
      mean weight of 81.85 kg. The only significant differences in baseline clinical 
      characteristics between groups were the mean number of years since heart 
      transplantation (3.62 CsA/MMF vs 8.53 RAPA/MMF; P<0.01) and the proportions of 
      patients still receiving corticosteroids (44.7% vs 13.3%, respectively; P<0.01). 
      Reported adverse events were generally mild, including leukopenia (8.1%), 
      diarrhea (6.5%), and abdominal pain (4.8%), and did not require drug 
      discontinuation. In patients receiving CsA/MMF, MPA AUCs ranged from 19.67 to 
      81.80 mg/h.L (mean [SD], 41.92 [14.14] mg/h.L). MPA Co levels were poorly 
      correlated with total AUC (r2=0.36). MPA Co levels of 0.5 and 1.6 mg/L were 
      correlated with AUCs of <30 and <40 mg/h.L, respectively. In patients receiving 
      RAPA/MMF, MPA AUCs ranged from 34.40 to 87.60 mg/h.L (mean, 51.07 [15.80] 
      mg/h.L). The correlation between Co and total AUC was better than in the CsA/MMF 
      group (r2=0.61). MPA C0 levels of 1.0 and 2.3 mg/L were correlated with AUCs of 
      30 and 40 mg/h.L, respectively. Statistically significant differences between 
      RAPA/MMF and CsA/MMF were noted in the mean MMF dosage (1.90 [0.71] vs 2.87 
      [0.78] g/d, respectively; P<0.001), the mean dose-adjusted MPA AUC (60.95 [27.42] 
      vs 31.92 [16.12] mg/h.L.g MMF; P<0.001), and mean dose-adjusted MPA C0 levels 
      (5.10 [3.41] vs 1.41 [0.95] mg/L.g; P<0.001). The dose-adjusted increase to Cmax 
      after morning dosing was comparable between groups, and there was no difference 
      in the frequency distribution of Cmax. In the group switched from the 
      CsA-containing regimen to the RAPA-containing regimen, the changes in MMF dose, 
      dose-adjusted AUC, and MPA C0 levels were similar to those in the CsA/MMF and 
      RAPA/MMF groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this comparison of measured MPA C0 levels and 
      12-hour MPA AUCs estimated by a limited-sampling strategy in stable heart 
      transplant patients receiving chronic maintenance immunosuppressive therapy with 
      CsA/MMF or RAPA/MMF, abbreviated AUC estimation predicted drug exposure more 
      accurately than did measured C0 levels. Thus, MPA AUCs obtained by limited 
      sampling may be useful in guiding clinical management and dosing. However, 
      further study is required, including validation of these findings in clinical 
      outcome studies.

PG  - 3656-69
LID - 10.1016/j.actbio.2011.06.015 [doi]
AB  - To date cancer is considered as one of the most devastating diseases due to its 
      high rate of mortality. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the Akt/mTOR 
      (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway is activated in cancers and inhibition of 
      this pathway has great potential in anti-cancer therapy. Rapamycin, one of the 
      most potent anti-cancer drugs, blocks Akt/mTOR function and has 
      anti-proliferative activity in several cancers. To circumvent problems associated 
      with rapamycin due to its poor water solubility, poor oral bioavailability, low 
      accessibility to cancer tissues and systemic toxicity, rapamycin-loaded cubic 
      nanoparticles (NP) were formulated with vitamin E d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene 
      glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) as an emulsifier for oral delivery. Cubic NP were 
      characterised and these particles demonstrated better cytotoxicity and apoptosis 
      compared with native rapamycin under in vitro conditions due to their enhanced 
      cellular uptake. The molecular impact of particulate systems on the Akt/mTOR 
      pathway were elucidated by immunoblotting. Down-regulation of different 
      anti-apoptotic genes of this pathway indicates activation of apoptotic signals 
      leading to MIA PaCa cell death. An in vivo study demonstrated enhanced 
      bioavailability of rapamycin in cubic NP in comparison with native rapamycin in a 
      mouse model with no toxicity and good biocompatibility of void cubic NP at a 
      higher dose of oral administration. Thus, rapamycin-loaded cubic NP can be used 
      as an effective drug delivery system to produce better rapamycin therapeutics for 
      the treatment of cancers.

TI  - Initial Dosage Recommendation for Sirolimus in Children With Tuberous Sclerosis 
      Complex.
PG  - 890

AB  - Sirolimus is already used in the treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), 
      however, with narrow therapeutic range and considerable inter- and 
      intra-individual pharmacokinetic variability, making it hard to develop an 
      appropriate sirolimus initial dosage regimen, especially in children with TSC. 
      The aim of this study was to recommend the optimal sirolimus initial dosing 
      regimen in pediatric patients with TSC. Underlying physiological and genetic 
      factors were collected to explore the effects on clinical sirolimus 
      concentrations by establishing a nonlinear mixed effect (NONMEM) model, and to 
      further simulate the optimal sirolimus initial dosing regimen using Monte Carlo 
      method in pediatric patients with TSC. The once-daily regimen and the twice-daily 
      regimen were recommended, respectively. For once-daily regimen, the dosages of 
      0.10, 0.07, 0.05, 0.04, 0.03 mg/kg/day were recommended for children with weights 
      of 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50, and 50-60 kg, respectively. For twice-daily 
      regimen, the dosages of 0.04, 0.03, 0.02 mg/kg/day (the daily dose was divided 
      evenly into two doses) were recommended for children with weights of 5-20, 20-40, 
      40-60 kg, respectively. The initial dosages of sirolimus in children with TSC 
      were recommended for the first time.

TI  - De novo kidney transplant recipients need higher doses of Advagraf compared with 
      Prograf to get therapeutic levels.
PG  - 2115-7
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2009.05.014 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Advagraf is a new modified-release once-daily formulation of 
      tacrolimus with a similar efficacy and safety profile to twice-daily tacrolimus 
      (Prograf) according to clinical trials. Few data are published about its use in 
      clinical practice, outside of sponsored clinical trials. We compared efficacy and 
      basic pharmacokinetics of once-daily and twice-daily tacrolimus in de novo renal 
      transplantation. METHODS: The Advagraf group included 26 de novo renal cases who 
      had received initial immunosuppression with once-daily tacrolimus (0.2 mg/kg from 
      day 1 posttransplantation) combined with mycophenolic acid, steroids, and 
      anti-CD25 monoclonal antibodies (2 doses). We compared them with a Prograf group 
      of 26 transplants performed immediately before, who received equivalent 
      immunosuppression with twice-daily tacrolimus (0.2 mg/kg from day 1). RESULTS: We 
      did not observe significant differences between groups in demographics, efficacy, 
      and basic pharmacokinetics, namely, tacrolimus trough levels at 7, 15, 30, 60, or 
      90 days. We found that recipients on Advagraf needed significantly higher 
      tacrolimus doses per kg up to 6 months post-transplantation than those on 
      Prograf: 0.16 vs 0.11; 0.14 vs 0.08; and 0.12 vs 0.08 mg/kg at 1, 3, and 6 
      months. No patient suffered severe liver dysfunction. There were no differences 
      between groups in the administration of drugs interacting with CYP3A4 or 
      prokinetics, which could alter tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSIONS: Among de 
      novo renal cases, the new once-daily formulation of tacrolimus offered a similar 
      short-term efficacy profile as the twice-daily tacrolimus. But it was necessary 
      to use up to a 50% higher dose of Advagraf than Prograf to achieve similar trough 
      levels during the first 6 months.

TI  - Phase I study of safety and tolerability of sunitinib in combination with 
      sirolimus in patients with refractory solid malignancies and determination of 
      VEGF (VEGF-A) and soluble VEGF-R2 (sVEGFR2) in plasma.
PG  - 1193-200
LID - 10.1007/s00280-016-3033-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sirolimus, an oral mTOR inhibitor, may complement the anti-angiogenic 
      and anti-tumor activity of sunitinib, an oral small molecule inhibitor of 
      multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, by vertical disruption of vascular epithelial 
      growth factor receptor (VEGFR) signaling, by reducing the compensatory production 
      of VEGF in sunitinib-treated patients and also by directly inhibiting tumor cell 
      proliferation. We conducted this phase 1 study to investigate the maximum 
      tolerated dose (MTD) for this combination of sunitinib and sirolimus in humans. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sunitinib was given at 50 mg daily × 28 every 6 weeks. The 
      first cohort received sunitinib alone for cycle 1 (50 mg daily for 2 weeks 
      followed by 2 weeks off) and received sunitinib at standard dose 50 mg daily for 
      4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off in combination with sirolimus 4 mg weekly; this 
      dose and schedule were further investigated in second cohort. The third cohort 
      received decreased dose of sunitinib at 37.5 mg daily for 4 weeks followed by 
      2 weeks off in combination with sirolimus at 4 mg weekly. Sirolimus dose was 
      escalated to 8 mg weekly in fourth cohort. RESULTS: Eighteen patients with ECOG 
      PS of 0 or 1 were enrolled, median age 57 years (range 24-76), M:F ratio: 11:7. 
      Median number of prior treatments is 2 (range 0-5); six patients had no prior 
      systemic therapy. Half of patients from the first two cohorts required dose 
      reduction or early discontinuation of treatment; therefore, sunitinib dose was 
      decreased to 37.5 mg daily in third and fourth cohort. In third and fourth 
      cohort, one-third of patients required dose modification during cycle 1 or cycle 
      2. Multiple patients had significant toxicities including fatigue and hand-foot 
      syndrome. One patient developed interstitial pneumonitis, and one patient died 
      suddenly on day 8 due to progressive disease. There were six patients who 
      tolerated four or more cycles. Among these six patients, two patients with renal 
      cell carcinoma (RCC) achieved partial response; one subsequently underwent 
      surgical resection of residual renal mass and lymph node dissection and achieved 
      complete response afterward. One with metastatic melanoma also achieved complete 
      response after metastatectomy. There was no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction 
      between sunitinib and sirolimus. 4 mg weekly sirolimus did not reduce the 
      sunitinib-induced circulating VEGF production but stimulated more VEGF production 
      through some unknown compensatory mechanism. CONCLUSION: Toxicity precluded dose 
      escalation of weekly sirolimus in combination with a standard sunitinib 
      dose/schedule. These results suggest caution when combining targeted agents 
      lacking specificity for tumor signaling or vasculature.

TI  - Stability of sirolimus and everolimus measured by immunoassay techniques in whole 
      blood samples from kidney transplant patients.
PG  - 297-307
AB  - The measurement of blood concentration of immunosuppressive drugs is strongly 
      recommended because of the narrow therapeutic range. An important aspect in the 
      therapeutic monitoring of a drug is its possible degradation. This paper is aimed 
      at investigating the stability of two widely-used immunosuppressants, sirolimus 
      and everolimus. Short (storage at 30 degrees C for 3 or 7 days) and long term 
      (storage at -20 degrees C for 0-90 days with a single freeze-thaw cycle) 
      stability of sirolimus and everolimus in whole blood samples from kidney 
      transplant patients were examined by using MEIA and FPIA. Sirolimus and 
      everolimus samples stored at 30 degrees C in light for up to a week showed a 
      decrement in concentration of 5.2 percent and 6.1 percent, respectively. Our 
      findings on long term stability for both sirolimus and everolimus highlight the 
      possibility of storing samples at -20 degrees C for up to 90 days, without the 
      need to use lower storage temperatures. The results have important implications 
      for patients living far from laboratories where drug concentration is measured or 
      when the storing of blood samples is needed for pharmacokinetic studies.

TI  - Development of a novel prohealing stent designed to deliver sirolimus from a 
      biodegradable abluminal matrix.
PG  - 257-66
LID - 10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.109.919936 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to demonstrate that, by separating endothelial progenitor 
      cell capture from sirolimus delivery through the application of drug to the 
      abluminal surface of the stent, the degree of endothelialization can be enhanced. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Stainless steel R Stents, with biodegradable SynBiosys 
      polymer coating with sirolimus abluminally applied and surface modified with 
      anti-CD34 antibody were prepared at 2 dosages (low-dose sirolimus [LD-Combo, 2.5 
      microg sirolimus/mm] and full-dose sirolimus [Combo, 5 microg sirolimus/mm). 
      These Combo stents and the Cypher stent (10 microg sirolimus/mm) were deployed in 
      98 normal porcine arteries and harvested for pharmacokinetic analysis at 0.25, 1, 
      3, 7, 14, 28, and 35 days. The LD-Combo stents showed faster early release 
      (50%total dose in 72 hours) than the Combo and Cypher. At 30 days, drug release 
      was near complete with both Combo stents, whereas 20% of drug remained on the 
      Cypher stents. To assess efficacy, a total of 50 stents (Xience V=8, Cypher=8, 
      Genous bioengineered R stent=6, LD-Combo=14, and Combo=14) were implanted in 18 
      pigs for 14 and 28 days. Optical coherence tomography was performed, and stents 
      were harvested for histology. At 28 days, there was less neointimal thickness 
      with Combo (0.173+/-0.088 mm) compared with Cypher (0.358+/-0.225 mm), LD-Combo 
      (0.316+/-0.228 mm), and Xience V (0.305+/-0.252 mm; P<0.00001). 
      Immunohistochemical analysis of endothelialization showed that Genous 
      bioengineered R stent had the highest degree of platelet endothelial cell 
      adhesion molecule expression (87%) followed by the Combo (75%), LD-Combo (65%), 
      and Cypher (58%). CONCLUSIONS: Both optical coherence tomography and histology 
      demonstrate that anti-CD34 sirolimus-eluting stents promote endothelialization 
      while reducing neointimal formation and inflammation.

TI  - Significant sirolimus and dronedarone interaction in a kidney transplant 
      recipient.
PG  - 1338-41
LID - 10.1345/aph.1P114 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the potential clinically significant pharmacokinetic 
      interaction between sirolimus and dronedarone. CASE SUMMARY: A 67-year-old man 
      status post-kidney transplant in 2004 was maintained on an immunosuppressive 
      regimen consisting of sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. He had 
      been maintained for more than 1 year on a stable dose of sirolimus (5 mg/day), 
      with concentrations ranging between 5 and 13.5 ng/mL. The patient was admitted to 
      the hospital with a complaint of bloody diarrhea; shortly after admission, he 
      developed atrial fibrillation for which dronedarone 400 mg twice daily was 
      initiated. Sirolimus concentrations obtained 3 days after initiation of 
      dronedarone revealed a trough concentration that was increased by more than 
      3-fold (38.6 ng/mL) from his baseline trough concentration. After sirolimus was 
      held for 6 days, the trough concentration was 7.8 ng/mL. The dosage was reduced 
      to 1 mg/day; there was no need for further adjustment. DISCUSSION: While the 
      potential for an interaction between sirolimus and dronedarone is listed in the 
      package insert of dronedarone, there are no documented reports of this 
      interaction in the peer-reviewed literature. Since sirolimus is a narrow 
      therapeutic index medication, information about the severity and magnitude of the 
      interaction with dronedarone may help clinicians avoid therapeutic misadventures 
      when this combination is employed. Our case clearly demonstrates a significant 
      pharmacokinetic interaction between sirolimus and dronedarone. The Horn Drug 
      Interaction Probability Scale indicates that the occurrence of an interaction 
      between sirolimus and dronedarone in our case is probable. CONCLUSIONS: Due to 
      the potential for sirolimus toxicity and excessive immunosuppression, the 
      concurrent use of dronedarone and sirolimus should be avoided when possible. If 
      concurrent administration cannot be avoided, we suggest close monitoring and a 
      50-75% dose reduction of sirolimus prior to dronedarone initiation.

TI  - Adventitial injection delivery of nano-encapsulated sirolimus (Nanolimus) to 
      injury-induced porcine femoral vessels to reduce luminal restenosis.

AB  - Endovascular therapy in peripheral intervention has grown exponentially in the 
      past decade, but the issue of high restenosis rates in lower extremity arteries 
      still persist. While drug-coated balloons (DCB) have been the device of choice, 
      recent controversary regarding the long-term safety of paclitaxel have raised 
      concern over current DCBs. In our study, we proposed that the direct injection of 
      a sirolimus nanoliposomal formulation (Nanolimus) using a infusion catheter can 
      attenuate inflammation response in injured vessels. In vitro characterization 
      showed retention of the nanoliposomes size and detectable drug amount up to 
      336 days in storage. For in vivo study, four female, mixed breed swines were 
      subjected to balloon injury of the femoral arteries before treatment with either 
      injection of saline (n = 4) or Nanolimus (n = 12) using the Bullfrog catheter. 
      Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated sustained sirolimus release in the arteries 
      and undetectable systemic drug level at 28 days. Arteries treated with Nanolimus 
      showed significant reduction in neointima area (0.2 ± 0.3 mm(2) vs 
      2.0 ± 1.2 mm(2), p < 0.01) and luminal stenosis (14.2 ± 7.2% vs. 67.7 ± 24.8%, 
      p < 0.01) compared to controls. In summary, adventitial delivery of sirolimus 
      using an infusion catheter is a feasible and safe method to reduce vascular 
      restenosis.

AB  - Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-inhibitor-containing immunosuppressive 
      regimens have been developed as part of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) 
      minimization/withdrawal strategies for renal transplant recipients, with the goal 
      of avoiding CNI-associated nephrotoxicity. This review focuses on the 
      pharmacokinetic interactions and exposure-response relationships of mTOR 
      inhibitors and tacrolimus (TAC), the most widely used CNI. We also discuss key 
      randomized clinical studies that have evaluated use of this combination in renal 
      transplantation. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that mTOR inhibitors, 
      everolimus (EVR) and sirolimus (SRL), have a large intra- and inter-patient 
      variability in drug exposure, and narrow therapeutic windows (trough levels [C0] 
      3-8 ng/mL and 5-15 ng/mL, respectively). Consequently, routine therapeutic drug 
      monitoring of EVR and SRL is recommended to optimize efficacy and minimize 
      toxicity in individual patients. As there is a good correlation between C0 and 
      area under the curve (AUC), C0 can be used as a convenient and reliable measure 
      of mTOR drug exposure. Clinical data on the use of EVR or SRL in TAC minimization 
      strategies in renal transplantation are limited. Available evidence suggests that 
      treatment with EVR allows early and substantial TAC minimization when used with 
      basiliximab induction and corticosteroids, to achieve good renal function without 
      compromising efficacy or safety. However, data comparing this combination with 
      other regimens are lacking. Results with SRL are more mixed. SRL in combination 
      with reduced TAC has been shown to provide less nephrotoxicity than the 
      SRL/standard TAC combination, with comparable efficacy and safety. However, this 
      approach has been shown to be inferior to other regimens in terms of 
      patient/graft survival and biopsy-proven acute rejection (vs MMF/TAC) as well as 
      renal function (vs MMF/TAC and SRL/MMF). Further studies are needed to define the 
      therapeutic window for TAC when used in combination with mTOR inhibitors, 
      evaluate EVR/reduced TAC versus other regimens, assess long-term outcomes, and 
      determine efficacy and safety in high-risk patients.

TI  - Tissue distribution and clinical monitoring of the novel macrolide 
      immunosuppressant SDZ-RAD and its metabolites in monkey lung transplant 
      recipients: interaction with cyclosporine.
PG  - 323-32
AB  - We report the tissue distribution and clinical monitoring of the novel macrolide 
      immunosuppressant SDZ-RAD ¿40-O-(2-hydroxyethyl)-rapamycin and its metabolites in 
      monkey lung transplant recipients as well as its interaction with cyclosporine as 
      the Neoral formulation. After left unilateral lung transplantation, cynomolgus 
      monkeys received by oral administration either 1) 1.5 mg/kg/day SDZ-RAD (n = 4); 
      2) 100 mg/kg/day cyclosporine (n = 4); 3) 0.3 mg/kg/day SDZ-RAD + 100 mg/kg/day 
      cyclosporine (n = 6); 4) 1.5 mg/kg/day SDZ-RAD + 50 mg/kg/day cyclosporine (n = 
      5); or 5) SDZ-RAD and cyclosporine doses adjusted according to trough blood 
      concentration measurements (n = 6). At the end of the observation period (usually 
      29 days after transplantation), and 24 h after the last doses, tissue samples 
      were collected and analyzed with HPLC/mass spectrometry. Gall bladder, pancreas, 
      the transplant lung, cerebellum, kidneys, and spleen had the highest SDZ-RAD 
      concentrations. Coadministration of cyclosporine increased SDZ-RAD concentrations 
      in most tissues as well as tissue-to-blood distribution coefficients. In 
      contrast, SDZ-RAD had only a small effect on cyclosporine blood and tissue 
      concentrations. Rejection in lung grafts in monkeys treated with either of the 
      cyclosporine/SDZ-RAD combinations was significantly less than in the monotherapy 
      groups (P <.002). Histological rejection scores were inversely correlated with 
      SDZ-RAD concentrations in blood (r = -0. 68; P <.001; n = 24), lymph nodes (P = 
      -0.58; P <.003; n = 24), thymus (r = -0.63; P <.001; n = 23) and transplant lung 
      tissue (r = -0.58; P <.003; n = 24). We conclude that, in addition to the 
      synergistic pharmacodynamic interaction, a pharmacokinetic interaction resulting 
      in higher SDZ-RAD tissue concentrations contributed to the significantly better 
      immunosuppressive efficacy when both drugs were combined compared with 
      monotherapy.

AB  - Ongoing clinical trials target the aberrant PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of 
      rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in breast cancer through administration of rapamycin, an 
      allosteric mTOR inhibitor, in combination with paclitaxel. However, synergy may 
      not be fully exploited clinically because of distinct pharmacokinetic parameters 
      of drugs. This study explores the synergistic potential of site-specific, 
      colocalized delivery of rapamycin and paclitaxel through nanoparticle 
      incorporation. Nanoparticle drug loading was accurately controlled, and 
      synergistic drug ratios established in vitro. Precise drug ratios were maintained 
      in tumors 48 hours after nanoparticle administration to mice, at levels twofold 
      greater than liver and spleen, yielding superior antitumor activity compared to 
      controls. Simultaneous and preferential in vivo delivery of rapamycin and 
      paclitaxel to tumors yielded mechanistic insights into synergy involving 
      suppression of feedback loop Akt phosphorylation and its downstream targets. 
      Findings demonstrate that a same time, same place, and specific amount approach 
      to combination chemotherapy by means of nanoparticle delivery has the potential 
      to successfully translate in vitro synergistic findings in vivo. Predictive in 
      vitro models can be used to determine optimum drug ratios for antitumor efficacy, 
      while nanoparticle delivery of combination chemotherapies in preclinical animal 
      models may lead to enhanced understanding of mechanisms of synergy, ultimately 
      opening several avenues for personalized therapy.

TI  - Beyond cyclosporine: a systematic review of limited sampling strategies for other 
      immunosuppressants.
PG  - 419-30
AB  - Therapeutic drug monitoring has gained much attention in the management of 
      immunosuppressive therapy. Area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve 
      (AUC) is the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter most commonly used to assess total 
      exposure to a drug. However, estimation of AUC requires multiple blood samples 
      throughout the dosing period, which is often inconvenient and expensive. Limited 
      sampling strategies (LSSs) are therefore developed to estimate AUC and other PK 
      parameters accurately and precisely while minimizing the number of blood samples 
      needed. This greatly reduces costs, labor and inconvenience for both patients and 
      clinical staff. In the therapeutic management of solid organ transplantation, 
      LSSs for cyclosporine are commonplace and have been extensively reviewed. Thus, 
      this systematic review paper focuses on other immunosuppressive agents and 
      categorizes the 24 pertinent citations according to the U.S. Preventive Services 
      Task Force rating scale. Thirteen articles (3 level I, 1 level II-1, 2 level 
      II-2, and 7 level III) involved LSSs for mycophenolate, 7 citations (1 level I 
      and 6 level III) for tacrolimus (TAC), and 3 citations (all level III) for other 
      drugs (sirolimus) or multiple drugs. The 2 main approaches to establishing LSSs, 
      multiple regression and Bayesian analyses, are also reviewed. Important elements 
      to consider for future LSS studies, including proper validation of LSSs, 
      convenient sampling times, and application of LSSs to the appropriate patient 
      population and drug formulation are discussed. Limited sampling strategies are a 
      useful tool to help clinicians make decisions on drug therapy. However, patients' 
      pathophysiology, environmental and genetic factors, and pharmacologic response to 
      therapy, in conjunction with PK profiling tools such as LSSs, should be 
      considered collectively for optimal therapy management.

TI  - Phase II study of the safety and efficacy of temsirolimus in East Asian patients 
      with advanced renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 836-44
LID - 10.1093/jjco/hys110 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Temsirolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, is 
      approved for treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma in the USA 
      and Europe. Temsirolimus was not yet evaluated in East Asian patients. METHODS: 
      This non-randomized Phase II study enrolled 82 patients with advanced renal cell 
      carcinoma [20 (24%) Japanese, 30 (37%) Korean and 32 (39%) Chinese patients; 
      median age (range): 55 (26-83) years]. Most (71%) received prior systemic therapy 
      for metastatic disease; two-thirds were intermediate risk. Six Japanese patients 
      received intravenous temsirolimus 20 mg/m(2) weekly for tolerability assessment 
      (Group A); the remaining 76 received a 25 mg flat dose weekly (Group B). 
      Temsirolimus was dosed once weekly. Primary efficacy end point was the Response 
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors-defined clinical benefit rate in the 
      intent-to-treat population. RESULTS: In the entire population, regardless of 
      treatment group, the clinical benefit rate was 48% (95% confidence interval: 36, 
      59). Objective response rate was 11% (95% confidence interval: 5, 20), median 
      progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% confidence interval: 4.0, 9.2) and 
      median time to treatment failure was 5.4 months (95% confidence interval: 3.5, 
      7.4). No patient in Group A demonstrated dose-limiting toxicity. The most 
      frequent Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events were anemia, hyperglycemia, 
      hypophosphatemia and stomatitis (5% each). Serious adverse events reported in ≥ 
      5% of patients were pneumonia (9%) and interstitial lung disease (7%). 
      Temsirolimus and its major metabolite, sirolimus, were long-lived throughout the 
      dosage interval, with no evidence of accumulation. CONCLUSION: Temsirolimus was 
      well tolerated and showed promising activity in Japanese, Korean and Chinese 
      patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.

TI  - Intralacrimal Sustained Delivery of Rapamycin Shows Therapeutic Effects without 
      Systemic Toxicity in a Mouse Model of Autoimmune Dacryoadenitis Characteristic of 
      Sjögren's Syndrome.
PG  - 1102-1114
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.0c01468 [doi]
AB  - Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease associated with severe 
      exocrinopathy, which is characterized by profound lymphocytic infiltration 
      (dacryoadenitis) and loss of function of the tear-producing lacrimal glands 
      (LGs). Systemic administration of Rapamycin (Rapa) significantly reduces LG 
      inflammation in the male Nonobese Diabetic (NOD) model of SS-associated 
      autoimmune dacryoadenitis. However, the systemic toxicity of this potent 
      immunosuppressant limits its application. As an alternative, this paper reports 
      an intra-LG delivery method using a depot formulation comprised of a 
      thermoresponsive elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) and FKBP, the cognate receptor 
      for Rapa (5FV). Depot formation was confirmed in excised whole LG using cleared 
      tissue and observation by both laser-scanning confocal and lightsheet microscopy. 
      The LG depot was evaluated for safety, efficacy, and intra-LG pharmacokinetics in 
      the NOD mouse disease model. Intra-LG injection with the depot formulation (5FV) 
      retained Rapa in the LG for a mean residence time (MRT) of 75.6 h compared to 
      Rapa delivery complexed with a soluble carrier control (5FA), which had a MRT of 
      11.7 h in the LG. Compared to systemic delivery of Rapa every other day for 2 
      weeks (seven doses), a single intra-LG depot of Rapa representing 16-fold less 
      total drug was sufficient to inhibit LG inflammation and improve tear production. 
      This treatment modality further reduced markers of hyperglycemia and 
      hyperlipidemia while showing no evidence of necrosis or fibrosis in the LG. This 
      approach represents a potential new therapy for SS-related autoimmune 
      dacryoadenitis, which may be adapted for local delivery at other sites of 
      inflammation; furthermore, these findings reveal the utility of optical imaging 
      for monitoring the disposition of locally administered therapeutics.

TI  - Randomized Open-Label Phase II Trial of Apitolisib (GDC-0980), a Novel Inhibitor 
      of the PI3K/Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Pathway, Versus Everolimus in Patients 
      With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.
PG  - 1660-8
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2015.64.8808 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to compare dual 
      inhibition of PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by apitolisib (GDC-0980) 
      against single inhibition of mTORC1 by everolimus in metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma (mRCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with clear-cell mRCC who 
      progressed on or after vascular endothelial growth factor-targeted therapy were 
      randomly assigned to apitolisib 40 mg once per day or to everolimus 10 mg once 
      per day. End points included progression-free survival, safety, overall survival, 
      and objective response rate. Biomarker assessments were conducted. RESULTS: 
      Eighty-five patients were randomly assigned. After 67 events, stratified analysis 
      revealed that median progression-free survival was significantly shorter for 
      apitolisib than for everolimus (3.7 v 6.1 months; hazard ratio, 2.12 [95% CI, 
      1.23 to 3.63; P < .01]); apitolisib was not favored in any stratification 
      subgroup. Median overall survival was not significantly different but trended in 
      favor of everolimus (16.5 v 22.8 months; hazard ratio, 1.77 [95% CI, 0.97 to 
      3.24; P = .06]). The objective response rate was 7.1% for apitolisib and 11.6% 
      for everolimus. Patients administered apitolisib with a greater incidence of 
      grade 3 to 4 adverse events were more likely to discontinue treatment (31% v 12% 
      for everolimus). No drug-related deaths were observed. Apitolisib in comparison 
      with everolimus was associated with substantially more high-grade hyperglycemia 
      (40% v 9%) and rash (24% v 2%). Apitolisib pharmacokinetics suggested a 
      relationship between exposure, and rash and hyperglycemia. Retrospective 
      biomarker analyses revealed a relationship between VHL mutation status and 
      outcome with everolimus but not with apitolisib. High hypoxia-inducible factor 1α 
      protein expression was associated with better outcome in both arms. CONCLUSION: 
      This study demonstrated that dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition by apitolisib was less 
      effective than was everolimus in mRCC, likely because full blockade of PI3K/mTOR 
      signaling resulted in multiple on-target adverse events. VHL mutation and 
      hypoxia-inducible factor 1α expression may be predictive of an mTOR inhibitor 
      benefit, although prospective validation is required.

TI  - Pharmacodynamic-guided modified continuous reassessment method-based, 
      dose-finding study of rapamycin in adult patients with solid tumors.
PG  - 4172-9
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2008.16.2347 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Pharmacodynamic studies are frequently incorporated into phase I trials, 
      but it is uncommon that they guide dose selection. We conducted a dose selection 
      study with daily rapamycin (sirolimus) in patients with solid tumors employing a 
      modified continuous reassessment method (mCRM) using real-time pharmacodynamic 
      data as primary dose-estimation parameter. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We adapted the 
      mCRM logit function from its classic toxicity-based input data to a 
      pharmacodynamic-based input. The pharmacodynamic end point was skin phospho-P70 
      change after 28 days. Pharmacodynamic effect was defined as at least 80% 
      inhibition from baseline. The first two dose levels (2 and 3 mg) were evaluated 
      before implementing the mCRM, and the data used to estimate the next dose level 
      based on statistical modeling. Toxicity-based boundaries limited the escalation 
      steps. Other correlates analyzed were positron emission tomography (PET) and 
      computed tomography, pharmacokinetics, phospho-P70 in peripheral-blood 
      mononuclear cells, and tumor biopsies in patients at the maximum-tolerated dose 
      (MTD). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled at doses between 2 and 9 mg. 
      Pharmacodynamic effect occurred across dose levels, and toxicity boundaries 
      ultimately drove dose selection. The MTD of daily oral rapamycin was 6 mg. 
      Toxicities in at least 20% were hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, elevated 
      transaminases, anemia, leucopenia, neutropenia, and mucositis. Pharmacokinetics 
      were consistent with prior data, and exposure increased with dose. No objective 
      responses occurred, but five previously progressing patients received at least 12 
      cycles. PET showed generalized stable or decreased glucose uptake unrelated to 
      antitumor effect. CONCLUSION: mCRM-based dose escalation using real-time 
      pharmacodynamic assessment was feasible. However, the selected pharmacodynamic 
      end point did not correlate with dose. Toxicity ultimately drove dose selection. 
      Rapamycin is a well-tolerated and active oral anticancer agent.

TI  - T-cell function monitoring in stable renal transplant patients treated with 
      sirolimus monotherapy.
PG  - 247-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is an agent with lymphocyte-specific features similar to 
      those of calcineurin inhibitors but with a different mechanism of action and 
      safety profile. To optimize the use of sirolimus-based immunosuppression, further 
      investigation of appropriate pharmacokinetic (sirolimus exposure) and 
      pharmacodynamic (sirolimus T-cell immunomodulator effect) monitoring is required 
      to determine personalized target concentrations. AIM: The main objective of the 
      study was to evaluate the feasibility and reproducibility of combined 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic monitoring and to apply biomarkers of 
      immunosuppression in stable kidney transplant recipients receiving sirolimus 
      monotherapy. METHODS: Fourteen renal transplant patients treated with sirolimus 
      monotherapy (median 2 years) were included in this study. Pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic parameters were evaluated in each patient three times: at 
      inclusion in the study (day 1), then again at 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: The median 
      sirolimus concentration was 11.5 ng/mL. CD4+ T-cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
      concentrations (150 ng/mL) and interleukin (IL)-10 production (50.9 ng/mL) were 
      significantly lower in treated patients than in healthy controls (n = 95) [301 
      ng/mL; 278 ng/mL, respectively]. Median inhibition of T-cell proliferation was 
      60% (31-96%) in treated patients. Interferon-gamma and transforming growth 
      factor-beta production was found to be similar to those in the healthy controls. 
      Our results suggest an association between low ATP and IL-10 concentrations and 
      the presence of infection. CONCLUSIONS: The sequential measurement of these 
      biomarkers in stable renal transplant recipients treated with monotherapy could 
      be useful to evaluate the biological effect of sirolimus in each patient and to 
      establish personalized therapy taking into account the individual response to the 
      drug.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of sirolimus (Rapamycin) in blood by high-performance 
      liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 251-7
AB  - We report here a quantitative method for the analysis of sirolimus in blood using 
      solid-phase sample preparation and HPLC-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry 
      detection. Blood samples (500 microl) were prepared by pre-treatment with 
      acetonitrile: 15 mM zinc sulphate (70:30, v/v), containing 32-demethoxysirolimus 
      (internal standard) and C18 solid-phase extraction. The electrospray conditions 
      were chosen to enhance the [M+NH4]+ species at the expense of other species. 
      Detection was by multiple reactant monitoring with the mass transitions m/z 
      931.8-->864.6 and m/z 901.8-->834.4 employed for sirolimus and the internal 
      standard, respectively. The method was linear over the range 0.2 to 100.0 microg 
      l(-1). The accuracy and inter-day precision, over this concentration range, was 
      94.4% to 104.4% and 1.4% to 5.0%, respectively. The accuracy and total precision 
      at the limit of quantitation (0.2 microg l(-1)) was 103.0% and 10.8%, 
      respectively. The mean absolute recovery of sirolimus and the internal standard 
      were 80.5% and 81.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and analytical concentration 
      range of the method make it suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring and 
      pharmacokinetic studies. Further, the ability of the method to measure parent 
      drug specifically will facilitate the evaluation of immunoassays for sirolimus.

TI  - Synergistic interactions between sorafenib and everolimus in pancreatic cancer 
      xenografts in mice.
PG  - 1231-40
LID - 10.1007/s00280-013-2117-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Molecular targeting of cellular signaling pathways is a promising 
      approach in cancer therapy, but often fails to achieve sustained benefit because 
      of the activation of collateral cancer cell survival and proliferation pathways. 
      We tested the hypothesis that a combination of targeted agents that inhibit 
      compensatory pathways would be more effective than single agents in controlling 
      pancreatic cancer cell growth. We investigated whether everolimus, an mTOR 
      inhibitor, and sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, would together inhibit growth 
      of low-passage, patient-derived pancreatic cancer xenografts in mice more 
      efficaciously than either agent alone. METHODS: Tumor volume progression was 
      measured following treatment with both drugs as single agents, in combination, 
      and at multiple doses. Pharmacokinetics in tumors and other tissues was also 
      assessed. Pharmacodynamic interactions were evaluated quantitatively. RESULTS: A 
      5-week regimen of daily oral doses of 10 mg/kg sorafenib and 0.5 mg/kg 
      everolimus, alone and in combination, did not achieve significant tumor growth 
      inhibition. Higher doses (20 mg/kg of sorafenib and 1 mg/kg of everolimus) 
      inhibited tumor growth significantly when given alone and caused complete 
      inhibition of growth when given in combination. Tumor volume progression was 
      described by a linear growth model, and drug effects were described by Hill-type 
      inhibition. Using population modeling approaches, dual-interaction parameter 
      estimates indicated a highly synergistic pharmacodynamic interaction between the 
      two drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that combinations of mTOR and 
      multi-kinase inhibitors may offer greater efficacy in pancreatic cancer than 
      either drug alone. Drug effects upon tumor stromal elements may contribute to the 
      enhanced anti-tumor efficacy.

TI  - Prediction of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions using human hepatocyte 
      suspension in plasma and cytochrome P450 phenotypic data. II. In vitro-in vivo 
      correlation with ketoconazole.
PG  - 1255-60
LID - 10.1124/dmd.107.018796 [doi]
AB  - Traditional cytochrome P450 (P450) based drug-drug interaction (DDI) predictions 
      are based on the ratio of an inhibitor's physiological concentration [I] and its 
      inhibition constant K(i). Determining [I] at the enzymatic site, although 
      critical for predicting clinical DDIs, remains a technical challenge. In our 
      previous study, a novel approach using cryopreserved human hepatocytes suspended 
      in human plasma was investigated to mimic the in vivo concentration of 
      ketoconazole at the enzymatic site (Lu et al., 2007), effectively eliminating the 
      estimation of the elusive [I] value. P450 inhibition in this system appears to 
      model that in vivo. Using the ketoconazole inhibition information in a human 
      hepatocyte-plasma suspension together with quantitative P450 phenotypic 
      information, we successfully predicted the pharmacokinetic DDIs for a small set 
      of drugs, such as theophylline, tolbutamide, omeprazole, desipramine, midazolam, 
      loratadine, cyclosporine, and alprazolam, as well as an investigational compound. 
      For the applicability of this model on a wider scale the in vitro-in vivo 
      correlation data set needed to be expanded. However, for most drugs in the 
      literature there is not enough quantitative information on the involvement of 
      individual P450s to predict DDIs retrospectively. To facilitate that, in this 
      study we determined quantitative P450 phenotyping for seven marketed drugs: 
      budesonide, buprenorphine, loratadine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, docetaxel, and 
      methylprednisolone. Augmentation of the new data set with the one generated 
      previously produced broader a database that provided further support for the 
      wider applicability of this approach using ketoconazole as a potent CYP3A 
      inhibitor. This application is predicted to be equally effective with other P450 
      inhibitors that are not substrates of efflux pumps.

      agent and in combination with rapamycin were studied in 3 early passage primary 
      pancreatic cancer xenografts, OCIP19, 21, and 23, grown orthotopically. METHODS: 
      Anti-cancer effects were determined in separate groups following chronic drug 
      exposure. Effects on cell cycle and downstream signalling were examined by flow 
      cytometry and western blot, respectively. Plasma RDEA119 concentrations were 
      measured to monitor the drug accumulation in vivo. RESULTS: RDEA119/BAY 869766 
      alone or in combination with rapamycin showed significant growth inhibition in 
      all the 3 models, with a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in 
      S-phase, accompanied by a large decrease in bromodeoxyuridine labelling and cell 
      cycle arrest predominantly in G1. The S6 ribosomal protein was inhibited to a 
      greater extent with combination treatment in all the three models. Blood plasma 
      pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that RDEA119 levels achieved in vivo are 
      similar to those that produce target inhibition and cell cycle arrest in vitro. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Agents targeting the ERK and mTOR pathway have anticancer activity 
      in primary xenografts, and these results support testing this combination in 
      pancreatic cancer patients.

TI  - A Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy as a Method for Evaluation of In Vivo 
      Poly-l-Lactide Biodegradation Kinetics From Stent-Polymer Matrices: An 
      Experimental Study Utilizing Porcine Model of In-Stent Restenosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to comprehensively evaluate poly-lactide polymer degradation 
      and sirolimus release kinetics from a drug-eluting stent matrix in the in vivo 
      setting using a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method. METHODS: In 22 domestic 
      swine, 18 biodegradable polymer-only coated stents (BPSs) and 36 biodegradable 
      polymer-coated sirolimus-eluting stents (BP-SES) were implanted in coronary 
      arteries with 115% overstretch. The animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 
      and 56 days following baseline procedures. Vessel segments with BPS were 
      harvested to evaluate polymer degradation with a NMR method, whereas BP-SES to 
      analyze sirolimus tissue uptake and retention. Additionally, 8 BP-SES were 
      implanted for histological analysis for 90 days of follow-up. RESULTS: The NMR 
      showed a gradual absorption of the polymer over the 6 consecutive time points, 
      from 5.48 µg of the polymer on the stent at 1-day follow-up, through 4.33 µg at 3 
      days, 3.16 µg at 7 days, 2.42 µg at 14 days, 1.92 µg at 28 days to 1.24 µg in the 
      last day of the study. The curve of polymer degradation corresponds well with the 
      pharmacokinetic profile of sirolimus eluted from its surface and measured at 
      identical time points. In histopathology, at 90 days, complete healing and 
      biocompatibility were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of NMR method for BP 
      absorption kinetics evaluation is a useful tool, which may be widely adopted to 
      test other biodegradable implants. Further, it may substantially improve their 
      safety and efficacy by facilitating programmed polymer and drugs elution.

AB  - Objective: To prepare everolimus nanoformulations and increase their solubility 
      to suit their application in the eye. Methods: The everolimus micelles was 
      prepared by thin film dispersion method using Tween-80 (P80) and polyoxyethylene 
      stearate (P40S) as carriers. In addition, the everolimus nanosuspension was 
      prepared by injection method using poloxamer 407 (P407), hydroxypropyl 
      methylcellulose (HPMC) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as stabilizers. It was 
      characterized in terms of particle size, PDI and encapsulation efficiency or drug 
      loading. The in vitro release and in vitro rabbit scleral permeability 
      characteristics were investigated, and the pharmacokinetics of anterior chamber 
      drug in rabbit eyes were studied. Results: The average particle size of the 
      micelles was (8.74 ± 0.21) nm, the encapsulation efficiency and drug loading were 
      (90.12 ± 1.18)% and (2.14 ± 0.028)%, while the average particle size of the 
      nanosuspension was (156.47 ± 1.10) nm, and the drug loading was (16.51 ± 0.21)%, 
      respectively. Both in vitro release and rabbit scleral permeation models were 
      consistent with the Higuchi equation. The pharmacokinetic experiments of aqueous 
      humor showed that area under the curve of everolimus nanosuspension was about 3 
      times higher than that of micelles. Micelles could be achieved in the eye and 
      maintained for a long time. Conclusion: The preparation of everolimus micelles or 
      nanosuspension for eye are suitable for ocular administration and expected to be 
      new dosage form for corneal transplantation immunological rejection or other 
      ocular disease.

TI  - Adjuvant Sirolimus Does Not Improve Outcome in Pet Dogs Receiving 
      Standard-of-Care Therapy for Appendicular Osteosarcoma: A Prospective, Randomized 
      Trial of 324 Dogs.
PG  - 3005-3016
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-0315 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The mTOR pathway has been identified as a key nutrient signaling hub 
      that participates in metastatic progression of high-grade osteosarcoma. 
      Inhibition of mTOR signaling is biologically achievable with sirolimus, and might 
      slow the outgrowth of distant metastases. In this study, pet dogs with 
      appendicular osteosarcoma were leveraged as high-value biologic models for 
      pediatric osteosarcoma, to assess mTOR inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for 
      attenuating metastatic disease progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 324 
      pet dogs diagnosed with treatment-naïve appendicular osteosarcoma were randomized 
      into a two-arm, multicenter, parallel superiority trial whereby dogs received 
      amputation of the affected limb, followed by adjuvant carboplatin chemotherapy ± 
      oral sirolimus therapy. The primary outcome measure was disease-free interval 
      (DFI), as assessed by serial physical and radiologic detection of emergent 
      macroscopic metastases; secondary outcomes included overall 1- and 2-year 
      survival rates, and sirolimus pharmacokinetic variables and their correlative 
      relationship to adverse events and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: There was no 
      significant difference in the median DFI or overall survival between the two arms 
      of this trial; the median DFI and survival for standard-of-care (SOC; defined as 
      amputation and carboplatin therapy) dogs was 180 days [95% confidence interval 
      (CI), 144-237] and 282 days (95% CI, 224-383) and for SOC + sirolimus dogs, it 
      was 204 days (95% CI, 157-217) and 280 days (95% CI, 252-332), respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In a population of pet dogs nongenomically segmented for predicted 
      mTOR inhibition response, sequentially administered adjuvant sirolimus, although 
      well tolerated when added to a backbone of therapy, did not extend DFI or 
      survival in dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma.

TI  - Sirolimus Dose Requirement in Kidney Transplant Recipients in Iran.
PG  - 510-516
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sirolimus (Rapamune) is an important immunosuppressive drug in 
      kidney transplant patients. The usual maintenance dose of Sirolimus in these 
      patients is 2 to 5 mg/d and its optimal maintenance trough level is 5 to 10 
      ng/mL. The required Sirolimus doses may differ markedly from patient to patient. 
      It is because of high inter and intrapatient variability in its pharmacokinetics. 
      There have been no studies in Iran on the correlation of Sirolimus blood level 
      and its target dose. This study has been done to show the target dose of 
      Sirolimus in kidney transplanted patients in Isfahan. METHODS: This is a 
      longitudinal cross-sectional study conducted from June 2018 to September 2019. 
      The study population included all kidney transplanted patients treated with 
      Sirolimus in a nephrology private clinic. Inclusion criteria were age (equal or 
      more than 18 years old) and the existence of complete data in the patient's file. 
      The participants were excluded if there were not at least two Sirolimus levels in 
      the patient's file. Demographics and other variables were extracted from the 
      patient's files. RESULTS: Sirolimus was prescribed for seventy-three patients. 
      Sixteen patients did not have the inclusion criteria. Fifty-seven renal 
      transplanted patients were included in the study. The mean starting dose of 
      Sirolimus in these patients was 2 ± 0.19 mg/d. The mean of the Sirolimus dose was 
      1.2 ± 0.44 mg/d. There was more than 20% GFR improvement in 68% of the patients 
      after changing the Calcineurin Inhibitor to Sirolimus (P < .05). CONCLUSION: In a 
      significant number of patients changing CNI to Sirolimus accompanied by GFR 
      improvement. Contrary to the recommended dose of Sirolimus in the references (2 
      to 5 mg/d) Iranian kidney transplant recipients needed lower daily doses of 
      Sirolimus (1.2 mg/d) to achieve the desired whole blood level. Further studies 
      are recommended to confirm it.

TI  - Bromodomain inhibitor OTX015 (MK-8628) combined with targeted agents shows strong 
      in vivo antitumor activity in lymphoma.
PG  - 58142-58147
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.10983 [doi]
AB  - The bromodomain inhibitor OTX015 (MK-8628) has shown anti-lymphoma activity as a 
      single agent in both the preclinical and clinical settings, as well as in vitro 
      synergism with several anticancer agents. Here, we report in vivo data for OTX015 
      in combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat, the Bruton's 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib, the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, 
      and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in a diffuse large B cell lymphoma model. The 
      antitumor effect of OTX015-containing combinations in SU-DHL-2 xenografts in mice 
      was much stronger than the activity of the corresponding single agents with 
      almost complete tumor eradication for all four combinations. Pharmacokinetic 
      analyses showed similar OTX015 levels in plasma and tumor samples of 
      approximately 1.5 μM, which is equivalent to the concentration showing strong in 
      vitro activity. For all four combinations, mean terminal levels of the 
      bromodomain inhibitor differed from those in mice exposed to single agent OTX015, 
      indicating a need for thorough pharmacokinetic investigations in phase I 
      combination studies. In conclusion, our results provide a strong rationale to 
      explore OTX015-containing combinations in the clinical lymphoma setting.

TI  - A Randomised Phase 2 Study of AZD2014 Versus Everolimus in Patients with 
      VEGF-Refractory Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cancer.
PG  - 450-6
LID - S0302-2838(15)00780-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.eururo.2015.08.035 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Everolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor used 
      in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-refractory metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma (mRCC). It acts on only part of the mTOR complex (TORC1 alone). In 
      vitro data support the use of mTOR inhibitors with broader activity (TORC1 and 
      TORC2). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether combined 
      TORC1 and TORC2 inhibition with AZD2014 has superior activity to everolimus in 
      VEGF-refractory clear cell mRCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients with 
      measurable mRCC and VEGF-refractory disease were eligible for this trial. 
      INTERVENTION: Starting in February 2013, patients were randomised (1:1) to 
      AZD2014 (50 mg twice daily) or everolimus (10 mg once daily) until progression of 
      disease at 10 centres across the United Kingdom. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND 
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end point 
      and was compared using the stratified log-rank test. Secondary end points 
      included tolerability, response rates, overall survival (OS), and 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis. The study was planned to recruit 120 patients. 
      RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Recruitment into the trial was stopped early (June 2014) 
      due to lack of efficacy of AZD2014. At that point, 49 patients were randomised 
      (26 to AZD2014 and 23 to everolimus). The PFS for AZD2014 and everolimus was 1.8 
      and 4.6 mo, respectively (hazard ratio: 2.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 
      1.2-6.5]; p=0.01). Progression of disease as the best response to therapy was 69% 
      for AZD2014 and 13% for everolimus (p<0.001). Grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) 
      occurred in 35% of AZD2014 and 48% of everolimus patients (p=0.3). Only 4% of 
      patients stopped AZD2014 due to AEs. PK analysis suggested concentrations of 
      AZD2014 were compatible with the therapeutic range. Final stratified OS hazard 
      ratio at the time of trial closure (January 2015) was 3.1 (95% CI, 1.1-8.4; 
      p<0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The PFS and OS of AZD2014 were inferior to everolimus in 
      this setting despite acceptable AE and PK profiles. PATIENT SUMMARY: There is a 
      strong rationale for testing mTOR inhibitors with a broader spectrum of activity 
      than everolimus in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. AZD2014 is such an 
      agent, but in this study, it was inferior to everolimus despite its attractive 
      toxicity profile.

TI  - Therapeutic drug monitoring for everolimus in heart transplant recipients based 
      on exposure-effect modeling.
PG  - 2126-31
AB  - Everolimus, a proliferation signal inhibitor, is an immunosuppressant that 
      targets the primary causes of progressive allograft dysfunction, thus improving 
      the long-term outcome after heart transplantation. The present study investigated 
      whether therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of everolimus would benefit heart 
      transplant patients. Data from a twelve-month phase III trial comparing 
      everolimus (1.5 or 3 mg daily) with azathioprine were used to evaluate everolimus 
      pharmacokinetics, exposure-efficacy/safety and TDM prognostic simulations. 
      Everolimus trough levels were stable in the first year post-transplant and 
      averaged 5.2 +/- 3.8 and 9.4 +/- 6.3 ng/mL in patients treated with 1.5 and 3 
      mg/day, respectively. Cyclosporine trough levels were similar in all treatment 
      groups. Biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) was reduced with everolimus trough 
      levels > or =3 ng/mL. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) analysis showed evidence of 
      reduced vasculopathy at 12 months with increasing everolimus exposure. Unlike 
      cyclosporine, increasing everolimus exposure was not related to a higher rate of 
      renal dysfunction. The TDM simulation, which was based on two everolimus dose 
      adjustments and an initial starting dose of 1.5 mg/day, showed that the simulated 
      BPAR rate (with TDM) was 21% versus 26% in the group with fixed dosing. 
      Therefore, TDM in heart transplantation could optimize immunosuppressive efficacy 
      and reduce treatment-related toxicity.

TI  - Suppression of acute rejection in allogeneic rat lung transplantation: a study of 
      the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of rapamycin derivative (SDZ RAD) used alone 
      and in combination with a microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine.
PG  - 150-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel immunosuppressant SDZ RAD, 40-0 (2-hydroxyethyl)rapamycin, 
      is an orally active rapamycin analogue developed for use in combination with 
      cyclosporine (Neoral). The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of 
      SDZ RAD, Neoral, or a combination of both drugs for suppression of acute 
      rejection in an allogeneic, unilateral rat lung transplant model. METHODS: 
      Brown-Norway (RT1n) donor lungs were implanted into Lewis (RT1l) recipients that 
      were observed for 21 days. Postoperative evaluation included daily weights, 
      serial chest radiographs, drug trough levels, and histology scores of the 
      transplanted lung on the day of sacrifice. Treatment groups were comprised of 
      rats treated orally with the RAD vehicle as controls (n = 6); SDZ RAD 2.5 
      mg/kg/day (n = 9); Neoral 7.5 mg/kg/day (n = 8); Neoral 2.5 mg/kg/day (n = 6); 
      SDZ RAD 2.5 mg/kg/day plus Neoral 7.5 mg/kg/day (n = 7); and Neoral 2.5 mg/kg/day 
      plus SDZ RAD 2.5 mg/kg/day (n = 6). RESULTS: The results of this study showed 
      that neither monotherapy with 2.5 mg/kg/day of Neoral, nor 2.5 mg/kg/day of SDZ 
      RAD prevented severe acute rejection in unilateral lung transplant recipients. 
      Furthermore, despite high dose (7.5 mg/kg/day) Neoral treatment, graft histology 
      showed moderate rejection. However, addition of 2.5 mg/kg/day of SDZ RAD to 7.5 
      mg/kg/day of Neoral completely prevented histologic rejection in four of seven 
      grafts, although the remaining 3 grafts showed minimal rejection. This 
      combination resulted in significantly higher RAD trough levels when compared to 
      SDZ RAD treatment alone. Combining a lower dose of Neoral (2.5 mg/ kg/day) with 
      2.5 mg/kg/day of SDZ RAD resulted in less weight loss and improved animal health; 
      however, the histology of lung grafts in these rats showed mild rejection. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on the efficacy of the novel rapamycin 
      derivative SDZ RAD for the control of acute lung allograft rejection. Results 
      showed that acute unilateral rat lung allograft rejection is refractory to 
      monotherapy with either high dose Neoral or SDZ RAD. The two regimens of combined 
      treatment with Neoral plus SDZ RAD used in these studies produced either minimal 
      rejection and reduced tolerability or mild rejection and better tolerability and 
      showed potentiation of immunosuppression when both drugs were used together. 
      Additional investigation of these two drugs is needed, however, to devise 
      regimens that produce both high immunosuppressive efficacy and good tolerability.

TI  - Impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms on P450 oxidoreductase and peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor alpha on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in renal 
      transplant recipients.
PG  - 42-52
LID - 10.1038/s41397-018-0061-1 [doi]
AB  - The P450 oxidoreductase (POR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
      alpha (PPARA) genes are associated with the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes 
      in vivo. We aimed to investigate the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs) in the POR and PPARA genes on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus (TAC) in 
      renal transplant recipients. A total of 220 recipients were assessed and 105 
      recipients were included for final quantitative analysis. Blood samples were 
      collected and DNA was extracted. Targeting sequencing based on next-generation 
      sequencing was applied to detect the SNPs in the POR and PPARA genes. In 
      addition, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to comprehensively 
      evaluate the influence of POR and PPARA mutations on the TAC concentrations. A 
      total of 81 SNPs were obtained. Three SNPs (POR*28, Chr7:75619677 and 
      Chr7:75614288) were found to be significantly associated with the TAC 
      pharmacokinetics at 3 months, 6 months, and more than 12 months. No significant 
      association was observed in the combined effect analysis of CYP3A4*1G and 
      CYP3A5*3 with three significant SNPs in the POR gene. Age, post-transplant 
      duration, and the use of sirolimus were identified as the most important factors 
      that influenced the TAC concentrations. A meta-analysis of four studies results 
      and our cohort indicated that compared with recipients carrying the CT or TT 
      genotypes, recipients carrying the CC genotypes of POR*28 showed significantly 
      higher TAC concentrations. Our study suggested the positive influence of 
      mutations in the POR gene on TAC exposure at 3 months after kidney 
      transplantation.

TI  - Nanomedicines in renal transplant rejection--focus on sirolimus.
PG  - 25-32
AB  - Nanomedicine, known as the application of nanotechnology in medicine, has been 
      applied to overcome the problems of poor bioavailability, in vitro and in vivo 
      stability, and targeted delivery in the preparation of pharmaceutical products. 
      Sirolimus, a water-insoluble immunosuppressant, has been formulated into an oral 
      solid dosage form by using NanoCrystal technology to increase the water 
      solubility and thereby the bioavailability. The efficacy, safety, and 
      pharmacokinetic properties are not significantly different between liquid and 
      solid formulations except that less fluctuation of sirolimus blood concentration 
      was observed in solid dosage form. The tablet formulation offers the advantages 
      of better palatability and more convenience for long-term use. Sirolimus tablets 
      are not only a successful example of nanomedicine, but also a more cost-effective 
      treatment in renal transplantation than cyclosporine and tacrolimus.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer is a relatively rare malignancy with a very aggressive natural 
      course, not restrained by the existing current treatments. At the 2012 American 
      Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, the results of few phase I 
      clinical studies on solid tumors and pancreatic cancer were presented. In 
      particular, in the field of immunotherapy, a pilot phase I study tested for first 
      time a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-based vaccine (Abstract #2561) on patients 
      with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and another one the optimal dose and efficacy of 
      trabedersen, an inhibitor of tissue growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-β2) aiming to 
      enhance antitumor immune responses (Abstract #4034). Other phase I studies 
      explored the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of an oral 
      gemcitabine pro-drug (LY2334737; Abstract #2554), or of the combination of 
      gemcitabine with sirolimus (Abstract #3096) or the combination of gemcitabine 
      with an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular 
      signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) (MEK 1/2; Abstract #4034).

TI  - Targeted and global pharmacometabolomics in everolimus-based immunosuppression: 
      association of co-medication and lysophosphatidylcholines with dose requirement.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.1007/s11306-017-1294-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The immunosuppressive therapy with everolimus (ERL) after heart 
      transplantation is characterized by a narrow therapeutic window and a substantial 
      variability in dose requirement. Factors explaining this variability are largely 
      unknown. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate factors affecting ERL metabolism and 
      to identify novel metabolites associated with the individual ERL dose requirement 
      to elucidate mechanisms underlying ERL dose response variability. METHOD: We used 
      liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry for quantification of ERL 
      metabolites in 41 heart transplant patients and evaluated the effect of clinical 
      and genetic factors on ERL pharmacokinetics. Non-targeted plasma metabolic 
      profiling by ultra-performance liquid chromatography and high resolution 
      quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to identify novel 
      metabolites associated with ERL dose requirement. RESULTS: The determination of 
      ERL metabolites revealed differences in metabolite patterns that were independent 
      from clinical or genetic factors. Whereas higher ERL dose requirement was 
      associated with co-administration of sodium-mycophenolic acid and the CYP3A5 
      expressor genotype, lower dose was required for patients receiving vitamin K 
      antagonists. Global metabolic profiling revealed several novel metabolites 
      associated with ERL dose requirement. One of them was identified as 
      lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) (16:0/0:0). Subsequent targeted analysis 
      revealed that high levels of several lysoPCs were significantly associated with 
      higher ERL dose requirement. CONCLUSION: For the first time, this study describes 
      distinct ERL metabolite patterns in heart transplant patients and detected 
      potentially new drug-drug interactions. The global metabolic profiling 
      facilitated the discovery of novel metabolites associated with ERL dose 
      requirement that might represent new clinically valuable biomarkers to guide ERL 
      therapy.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of sirolimus.
PG  - 573-85
AB  - Sirolimus (previously known as rapamycin), a macrocyclic lactone, is a potent 
      immunosuppressive agent. Sirolimus was recently approved by the US Food and Drug 
      Administration, on the basis of 2 large, double-blind, prospective clinical 
      trials, for use in kidney transplant recipients at a fixed dosage of 2 or 5 
      mg/day in addition to full dosages of cyclosporin and prednisone. However, 
      despite the fixed dosage regimens used in these pivotal trials, pharmacokinetic 
      and clinical data show that sirolimus is a critical-dose drug requiring 
      therapeutic drug monitoring to minimise drug-related toxicities and maximise 
      efficacy. Assays using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass 
      spectrometry, although cumbersome, are the gold standard for evaluating other 
      commonly used assays, such as liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection, 
      radioreceptor assay and microparticle enzyme immunoassay. Sirolimus is available 
      in oral solution and tablet form. It has poor oral absorption and distributes 
      widely in tissues, displaying not only a wide inter- and intrapatient variability 
      in drug clearance, but also less than optimal correlations between whole blood 
      concentrations and drug dose, demographic features or patient characteristics. 
      Furthermore, the critical role of the cytochrome P450 3A4 system for sirolimus 
      biotransformation leads to extensive drug-drug interactions, among which are 
      increases in cyclosporin concentrations. Thus, sirolimus is now being used to 
      reduce or eliminate exposure to cyclosporin or corticosteroids. The long 
      elimination half-life of sirolimus necessitates a loading dose but allows once 
      daily administration, which is more convenient and thereby could help to improve 
      patient compliance. This review emphasises the importance of blood concentration 
      monitoring in optimising the use of sirolimus. The excellent correlation between 
      steady-state trough concentration (at least 4 days after inception of, or change 
      in, therapy) and area under the concentration-time curve makes the former a 
      simple and reliable index for monitoring sirolimus exposure. Target trough 
      concentration ranges depend on the concomitant immunosuppressive regimen, but a 
      range of 5 to 15 microg/L is appropriate if cyclosporin is being used at trough 
      concentrations of 75 to 150 microg/L. Weekly monitoring is recommended for the 
      first month and bi-weekly for the next month; thereafter,concentration 
      measurements are necessary only if warranted clinically.

AB  - Sirolimus is an effective oral treatment for pediatric patients with 
      lymphangioma. The present clinical study in 15 children (0.12-16.39 years of age) 
      examines the effects of underlying factors on sirolimus concentrations through 
      application of a population pharmacokinetic model. Using Monte Carlo simulation, 
      an initial dose regimen for sirolimus in pediatric patients with lymphangioma is 
      presented. It is found that the lower the body weight, the higher the clearance 
      rate and sirolimus clearances are 0.31-0.17 L/h/kg in pediatric patients with 
      lymphangioma whose weights are 5-60 kg, respectively. The doses of sirolimus, 
      0.07, 0.06, 0.05 mg/kg/day are recommended for weights of 5-10, 10-24.5 and 
      24.5-60 kg in children with lymphangioma. This study is the first to establish a 
      population pharmacokinetic model for sirolimus and to recommend initial doses in 
      pediatric patients with lymphangioma. Large scale, prospective studies are needed 
      in the future.

TI  - Effective low-dose sirolimus regimen for kaposiform haemangioendothelioma with 
      Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon in young infants.
PG  - 2769-2781
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15202 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Management of kaposiform haemangioendotheliomas (KHE) with Kasabach-Merritt 
      phenomenon is challenging in young infants who are subjected to developmental 
      pharmacokinetic changes. Sirolimus, sometimes combined with corticosteroids, can 
      be used as an effective treatment of KHE. Simultaneously, toxicities such as 
      interstitial pneumonitis related to the use of sirolimus may be fatal. As infants 
      have a very low CYP3-enzyme expression at birth, which rises during ageing, we 
      hypothesize that a reduced metabolization of sirolimus might lead to high 
      sirolimus serum levels and low dose may be sufficient without the side effects. 
      METHODS: A case series of 5 infants with kaposiform haemangioendothelioma with 
      Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon was analysed retrospectively. All infants were 
      treated with sirolimus 0.2 mg/m(2) every 24 or 48 hours according to their age. 
      Prednisone was added to the therapy for additional effect in 4 patients. RESULTS: 
      In all patients, low dose of sirolimus led to therapeutic sirolimus levels 
      (4-6 ng/mL). All infants (aged 4 days-7 months) had a complete haematological 
      response, without serious adverse events. In all patients, the Kasabach-Merritt 
      phenomenon resolved, the coagulation profile normalized and tumour size reduction 
      was seen. CONCLUSION: Low-dose sirolimus treatment is safe for infants with 
      kaposiform haemangioendothelioma and Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon. It is essential 
      to realize that during the first months of life, metabolism is still developing 
      and enzymes necessary to metabolise drugs like sirolimus still have to mature. To 
      avoid toxic levels, the sirolimus dosage should be based on age and the 
      associated pharmacological developments.

TI  - A gold-based immunochromatographic strip for the detection of sirolimus in human 
      whole blood.
PG  - 1394-1402
LID - 10.1039/d1an02297k [doi]
AB  - Sirolimus is a potent macrolide immunosuppressant, with a long half-life, a 
      narrow therapeutic window, and large individual variations in pharmacokinetics. 
      In this study, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) and a 
      colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip were developed to establish a 
      rapid and efficient clinical screening of sirolimus. The hapten for sirolimus was 
      synthesized by the oximation reaction and then coupled to keyhole limpet 
      hemocyanin (KLH) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) to prepare the immunogen and 
      coating antigen. Based on highly specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the 50% 
      inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of the optimized ic-ELISA was 1.54 ng mL(-1) 
      and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.19 ng mL(-1) in whole blood samples. Good 
      specificity was revealed by its low cross-reactivity (CR) with several analogs of 
      sirolimus. The visual limit of detection (vLOD) and cut-off values of the strip 
      were 20 and 100 ng mL(-1) in whole blood samples, as assessed by the naked eye. 
      Therefore, both methods could be used as potentially rapid monitoring approaches 
      for the detection of sirolimus in human whole blood.

AB  - Intra-articular (IA) injection of a chondroprotective candidate may delay the 
      osteoarthritis (OA) course, but its rapid absorption into systemic circulation 
      may limit efficacy and produce untoward effects. We compared the pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) of IA rapamycin injected as sustained release in nanoparticles (NPs) versus 
      a free rapamycin suspension in the rat knee compared to an intravenous (IV) free 
      rapamycin shot taken as a reference. Rats received either a single IV injection 
      of free rapamycin (10 µM) or an IA of free or NPs-loaded rapamycin. After 
      sequential exsanguination (15, 30, 60, 180, 360 min, D1, and D7), knee synovial 
      tissue (ST) and cartilage histology were performed. Blood and ST concentrations 
      (LC-MS/MS), PK parameters (area under the curve: AUC; mean residence time: MRT; 
      elimination half-life: T(1/2)), and IA biocompatibility were assessed. AUC(IV) 
      was significantly higher for IV than for both IA injections (AUC(IA free) and 
      AUC(IA NPs)), with 4248 vs 28 and 74 µg.min.L(-1). For ST parameters, we observed 
      a significant difference between AUC(IA free) and AUC(IA NPs) with 3735 and 
      10513 µg.min.L(-1) correspondingly. Articular T(1/2) and MRT were higher after 
      NPs than after free rapamycin injection: 57.8 and 5.0 h for T(1/2) and 80.6 and 
      5.5 h for MRT, respectively. Histological analysis revealed no chondral injuries 
      and slight transient synovitis only 3 h after the administration of NPs. In the 
      rat knee, rapamycin-loaded NPs delivery via a single IA injection is 
      biocompatible and prolongs synovium joint residency, diminishes blood levels, and 
      reduces detrimental systemic exposure.

TI  - Five-year comparative study of thin-strut rapamycin-eluting bioabsorbable

PG  - 938519

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Using quantitative coronary angiography (QCA), optical coherence 
      tomography (OCT), histomorphometry, and pharmacokinetics, this study tried to 
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Biomagic rapamycin-eluting bioabsorbable 
      scaffold (BVS) in non-atherosclerotic porcine coronary arteries. BACKGROUND: 
      Biomagic BVS is a new generation of thin-strut bioabsorbable scaffold. We 
      conducted comparative study detailing pathological response, safety and efficacy 
      of Biomagic BVS and the Firebird2 rapamycin-eluting cobalt-based alloy stent 
      (DES) in a porcine coronary artery model. The animals were followed up at 14 
      days, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60 months after stent 
      implantation. METHODS: A total of 143 devices (95 Biomagic and 48 Firebird2) were 
      implanted in 2 or 3 main coronary arteries of 76 nonatherosclerotic swine and 
      examined by QCA, OCT, light microscopy, and pharmacokinetics analyses at various 
      time points. RESULTS: Vascular responses to Biomagic and Firebird2 were largely 
      comparable at all time points, with struts being sequestered within the 
      neointima. The degree of inflammation of both devices was mild to moderate, 
      although the Biomagic score was higher at 14 days to 24 months. However, there 
      was no statistical difference between the two groups except 14 days. At each 
      follow-up time point, the percentage of area stenosis in the Biomagic group was 
      greater than that in the Firebird 2 group, but there was no statistical 
      difference between the two groups at 3 and 12 months. The extent of fibrin 
      deposition was similar between Biomagic and Firebird2, which peaked at 1 month 
      and decreased rapidly thereafter. Pharmacokinetic study showed that coronary 
      tissue sirolimus concentration remained above 2 ng/mg of tissue at 28 day. 
      Histomorphometry showed expansile remodeling of Biomagic-implanted arteries 
      starting after 12 months, and lumen area was significantly greater in Biomagic 
      than Firebird2 at 36 and 42 months. These changes correlated with dismantling of 
      Biomagic seen after 12 months. OCT images confirmed that degradation of Biomagic 
      was complete by 36 months. CONCLUSIONS: Biomagic demonstrates comparable 
      long-term safety to Firebird2 in porcine coronary arteries with mild to moderate 
      inflammation. Although Biomagic was associated with greater percent stenosis 
      relative to Firebird2 within 36 months, expansile remodeling was observed after 
      12 months in Biomagic with significantly greater lumen area at ≥36 months. 
      Scaffold resorption is considered complete at 36 months.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetics of everolimus in adult liver transplant patients: 
      Comparison to tacrolimus disposition and extrapolation to pediatrics.
PG  - 2652-2662
LID - 10.1111/cts.13389 [doi]
AB  - Everolimus has recently been used to prevent graft rejection in liver 
      transplantation and reduces the incidence of kidney dysfunction caused by 
      calcineurin inhibitors. In this study, a population pharmacokinetic analysis was 
      conducted to improve the individualization of everolimus therapy. Japanese 
      post-liver transplant patients whose blood everolimus concentrations were 
      measured between March 2018 and December 2020 were included in this study. A 
      nonlinear mixed-effect modeling program was used to explore covariates that 
      affect everolimus pharmacokinetics. Individual everolimus pharmacokinetic 
      parameters estimated by the post-hoc Bayesian analysis using the final model were 
      compared with the tacrolimus dose per trough concentration (D/C) ratio in each 
      patient. The final model was extrapolated to pediatric liver transplant patients 
      for external evaluation. A total of 937 concentrations from 87 adult patients 
      were used in the model-building process. Everolimus clearance was significantly 
      affected by the estimated glomerular filtration rate, concomitant use of 
      fluconazole, sex, as well as total daily dose of everolimus (TDM effect). The 
      estimated individual apparent clearance of everolimus by the post-hoc Bayesian 
      analysis was moderately correlated with the D/C ratio of tacrolimus in each 
      patient (R(2)  = 0.330, p < 0.0001). The estimation accuracy in pediatric 
      patients was considerably high, except for one infant out of 13 patients. In 
      conclusion, population pharmacokinetic analysis clarified several significant 
      covariates for everolimus pharmacokinetics in liver transplant patients. 
      Everolimus pharmacokinetics moderately correlated with tacrolimus 
      pharmacokinetics and could be extrapolated from adult to pediatric patients by 
      body size correction, except for infants.

AB  - Sirolimus is used to treat pediatric patients with PIK3CD mutation-related 
      immunodeficiency disease. However, the initial dosages of sirolimus remain 
      undecided. The present study aims to explore initial dosages in pediatric 
      patients with PIK3CD mutation-related immunodeficiency disease. Pediatric 
      patients with this disease were analyzed using the population pharmacokinetic 
      (PPK) model and the Monte Carlo simulation. Body weight and concomitant use of 
      posaconazole were included in the final PPK model, where, under the same weight, 
      clearances of sirolimus were 1 : 0.238 between children without and children with 
      posaconazole. Without posaconazole, the initial dosages of sirolimus were 0.07, 
      0.06, 0.05, and 0.04 mg/kg/day for body weights of 10-14, 14-25, 25-50, and 
      50-60 kg, respectively. With posaconazole, the initial dosages of sirolimus were 
      0.02 mg/kg/day for body weights of 10-60 kg. This is the first attempt to build a 
      sirolimus PPK model for recommending initial dosages in children with PIK3CD 
      mutation-related immunodeficiency disease, thereby providing a reference for 
      individualized clinical drug administration.

      in Japanese Renal Transplant Patients.

LID - 11742
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of NR1I2 (7635G>A and 
      8055C>T) and ABCB1 (1236C>T, 2677G>T/A, and 3435C>T) genetic polymorphisms on 
      everolimus pharmacokinetics in 98 Japanese renal transplant patients. On day 15 
      after everolimus administration, blood samples were collected just prior to and 
      1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 h after administration. The dose-adjusted area under the 
      blood concentration−time curve (AUC0-12) of everolimus was significantly lower in 
      patients with the NR1I2 8055C/C genotype than in those with other genotypes (p = 
      0.022) and was significantly higher in male patients than female patients (p = 
      0.045). Significant correlations between the dose-adjusted AUC0-12 of everolimus 
      and age (p = 0.001), aspartate transaminase (p = 0.001), and alanine transaminase 
      (p = 0.005) were found. In multivariate analysis, aging (p = 0.008) and higher 
      alanine transaminase levels (p = 0.032) were independently predictive of a higher 
      dose-adjusted everolimus AUC0-12. Aging and hepatic dysfunction in patients may 
      need to be considered when evaluating dose reductions in everolimus. In renal 
      transplant patients, management using everolimus blood concentrations after 
      administration may be more important than analysis of NR1I2 8055C>T polymorphism 
      before administration.

AB  - The immunosuppressive agents sirolimus and everolimus are sensitive CYP3A4 
      substrates with narrow therapeutic index. Ritonavir is a strong CYP3A inhibitor. 
      A phase 1 study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and 
      tolerability of the co-administration of sirolimus or everolimus with the 
      ritonavir-containing 3D regimen of the direct-acting antiviral agents ombitasvir, 
      ritonavir-boosted paritaprevir, and dasabuvir in healthy subjects. This study had 
      two independent arms, each with a two-period, single-sequence, crossover study 
      design. A single dose of sirolimus 2 mg (N = 12) or everolimus 0.75 mg (N = 12) 
      was administered in Period 1. In Period 2, multiple doses of the 3D regimen 
      (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir 25/150/100 mg once daily and dasabuvir 250 mg 
      twice daily) were administered for 34 or 28 days, with a single dose of sirolimus 
      0.5 mg or everolimus 0.75 mg co-administered on Day 15. Following 
      co-administration with the 3D regimen, the sirolimus dose-normalized maximum 
      observed blood concentration (C(max) ) and area under the blood 
      concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(inf) ) increased to 
      6.4-fold and 38-fold, respectively. Following co-administration with the 3D 
      regimen, the everolimus C(max) and AUC(inf) increased to 4.7-fold and 27-fold, 
      respectively. Sirolimus and everolimus half-lives increased from 96 to 249 h, and 
      42 to 118 h, respectively. There were no major safety or tolerability issues in 
      this study. The ritonavir-containing 3D regimen resulted in a significant 
      increase in sirolimus or everolimus exposure, consistent with the known strong 
      inhibitory effect of ritonavir on CYP3A requiring dose and/or frequency 
      modification when co-administered with each other.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of Sirolimus Eye Drops Following Topical Ocular Administration 
      in Rabbits.
PG  - 735-743
LID - 10.1089/jop.2023.0035 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus eye drops following 
      topical instillation in rabbits. Methods: The study included 2 experiments. In 
      single-dose pharmacokinetic study, rabbits received a single bilateral 
      instillation of 0.05% sirolimus eye drops (0.5 mg/mL, 50 μL/eye). In repeat-dose 
      pharmacokinetic study, 0.05% sirolimus eye drops (0.5 mg/mL, 50 μL/eye/time) were 
      instilled into both eyes of rabbits four times a day for 6 consecutive days and 
      one time on day 7. Whole blood, tears, aqueous humor, cornea, and conjunctiva 
      samples were collected. Sirolimus concentration was determined by a validated 
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Sirolimus was hardly 
      detected in plasma or aqueous humor after either single or repeated dosing. The 
      C(max) of sirolimus in tears, cornea, and conjunctiva after a single instillation 
      was 163.34 ± 69.30 μg/g, 150.56 ± 84.98 ng/g, and 113.22 ± 49.82 ng/g, 
      respectively. As the number of instillation elevated, the C(max) of sirolimus was 
      increased to 486.18 ± 297.93 μg/g, 418.63 ± 41.07 ng/g, and 314.25 ± 63.74 ng/g, 
      respectively. In repeat-dose administration, the steady state of sirolimus 
      concentration was achieved on the third day. Ocular exposure to sirolimus after 
      single and repeated dosing, based on AUC(0-t), was highest in tears, followed by 
      cornea and conjunctiva. Compared with single administration, a significant 
      increase in sirolimus exposure as measured by AUC(0-t) was observed in tears, 
      cornea, and conjunctiva following repeated administration. Conclusions: Topical 
      administration of sirolimus eye drops results in extensive distribution of 
      sirolimus in tears, cornea, and conjunctiva, while aqueous humor and systemic 
      exposure were negligible. Repeat-dose administration increases sirolimus exposure 
      in tears, cornea, and conjunctiva.

AB  - Sirolimus, a potent immunosuppressant, has been demonstrated to have remarkable 
      activity in inhibiting allograft rejection in transplantation. The objective of 
      the study was to fabricate microsponge mini tablets with enhanced solubility and 
      bioavailability. β-Cyclodextrin and NEOCEL C91 were selected to prepare the 
      microsponges (SLM-M) to improve the stability and solubility of sirolimus. The 
      current study involved the quasi emulsion-solvent diffusion technique to design 
      sirolimus-loaded microsponges that were further compressed into mini tablets 4 mm 
      in diameter. Solid-state characterization, dissolution at different pH values, 
      stability, and pharmacokinetic profiles with IVIVC data were analyzed in humans. 
      Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry 
      (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the formulations, 
      and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to assess the drug 
      stability of the compressed microsponge minitablets. The API changed from the 
      crystalline state to an amorphous state, as shown by XRD and DSC. The compressed 
      mini tablets showed a 4-fold enhancement in the drug dissolution profile. A 
      toxicology investigation suggested that mini tablets were safe. In humans, the 
      bioavailability of sirolimus compressed mini tablets from SLM-M was significantly 
      improved. The results suggest that mini tablets prepared with β-cyclodextrin and 
      NEOCEL C91 by a quasi emulsion-solvent diffusion process might be an alternative 
      way to improve the bioavailability of sirolimus. In addition, the manufacturing 
      process is easily scalable for the commercialization of drugs to market.

      in mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Everolimus is an oral mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor 
      used as an immunosuppressant and anticancer. Its pharmacokinetics is highly 
      variable, it has a narrow therapeutic window and shows chronotoxicity with the 
      best time at ZT13 and worst time at ZT1 (ZT; Zeitgeber time, time after light 
      onset) in the preclinical setting. OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we aimed to 
      investigate whether the pharmacokinetics of everolimus vary according to dosing 
      time and whether sex and feeding status interfere with the 
      chronopharmacokinetics. METHOD: A single dosage of 5 mg/kg everolimus was 
      administered orally to C57BL/6J male and female mice, in fed or fasted states at 
      ZT1-rest and ZT13-activity times and blood and tissue samples were collected at 
      0.5, 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 h following drug administration. Ileum, liver, plasma, 
      and thymus concentrations of everolimus were determined. RESULTS: Females had a 
      greater ileum AUC(0-24h) than males when fed (P = 0.043). Everolimus AUC(0-24h) 
      in the liver was substantially greater at ZT1 than at ZT13 in a fasted state 
      (P = 0.001). Plasma C(max), AUC(0-24h), and AUC(total) were not statistically 
      significant between the groups (P = 0.098). In one of the target organs of 
      everolimus, the thymus, males had considerably higher amounts at ZT1 than females 
      (P = 0.029). CONCLUSION: Our findings imply that the pharmacokinetics of 
      everolimus in mice may differ according to dosing time, sex, and feeding. Greater 
      tissue distribution of everolimus at ZT1 may be associated with the worst 
      tolerated time of everolimus. Our research suggests that oral chronomodulated 
      everolimus therapy may be more effective and safer for cancer patients.

AB  - Everolimus is used for immunosuppression after renal transplantation. This study 
      aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model of everolimus using 
      therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data of patients under long-term multiple 
      immunosuppressive therapy, including tacrolimus. To develop the model, 185 renal 
      transplant recipients with 3358 everolimus blood concentrations during a median 
      postoperative period of 35.3 months were included. The PopPK model is described 
      as a one-compartment model with first-order absorption. The population mean of 
      apparent clearance is 8.92 L/h (relative standard error = 3.6%), and this 
      negatively correlated with the dose-normalized concentration (C/D) of tacrolimus 
      and hematocrit value, and positively correlated with a daily dose of everolimus 
      (i.e. TDM effect). The usefulness of dose adjustment using the final popPK model 
      was assessed by a simulation study. The ratio of the first trough measurement 
      within the therapeutic range of 3-8 ng/mL increased from 69.8% in the original 
      dose to 87.9% in the individual dose calculated by the final PopPK model. The 
      tacrolimus C/D ratio before initiating everolimus therapy and the hematocrit 
      value were useful to estimate the initial dose of everolimus and can improve the 
      safety and effectiveness of immunosuppressive therapy involving everolimus.

AB  - Intractable lymphatic malformations (iLM) pose a significant threat to affected 
      children, demonstrating limited responses to conventional treatments. Sirolimus, 
      effectively inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation in lymphatic vessels, plays 
      a crucial role in iLM treatment. However, the drug's narrow therapeutic window 
      and substantial interindividual variability necessitate customized dosing 
      strategies. This study aims to establish a Population Pharmacokinetic Model 
      (PopPK model) for sirolimus in pediatric iLM patients, identifying quantitative 
      relationships between covariates and sirolimus clearance and volume of 
      distribution. Initial dosages are recommended based on a target concentration 
      range of 5-15 ng/mL. Retrospective data from our institution, encompassing 53 
      pediatric patients with 275 blood concentration results over the past five years 
      (average age: 4.64 ± 4.19 years), constituted the foundation of this analysis. 
      The final model, adopting a first-order absorption and elimination 
      single-compartment model, retained age as the sole covariate. Results indicated a 
      robust correlation between apparent clearance (CL/F) at 5.56 L/h, apparent volume 
      of distribution (V/F) at 292.57 L, and age. Monte Carlo simulation guided initial 
      dosages for patients aged 0-18 years within the target concentration range. This 
      study presents the first PopPK model using a large Therapeutic Drug Monitoring 
      (TDM) database to describe personalized sirolimus dosing for pediatric iLM 
      patients, contributing to pharmacokinetic guidance and potentially improving 
      long-term clinical outcomes.

TI  - Comprehensive Assessment of Drug Kinetics, Neurotoxicity, and Safety of 
      Sirolimus-Eluting Intracranial Stents in Canine Basilar Artery.
PG  - 1199-1208

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sirolimus-eluting stents (SESs) have shown promise in 
      treating intracranial atherosclerosis but concerns about potential neurotoxicity 
      due to prolonged drug release exist. The aim of this study was to comprehensively 
      assess the safety of SES, with a focus on neurotoxicity. METHODS: Stents (1.50 × 
      7 or 12 mm) were implanted into the basilar arteries of 154 Labrador Retrievers 
      (weighing >25 kg and aged older than 1 year) divided into 4 groups: bare-metal 
      stent, polymer-coated stent, standard-dose SES (sirolimus dose: 71 μg), and 
      high-dose SES group (sirolimus dose: 284 μg). Pharmacokinetic analysis was 
      conducted using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry on blood and tissue 
      samples, and analysis of brain tissue was performed with 5 different special 
      stains and immunohistochemistry protocols to assess axonal degeneration, 
      vacuolization, astrocyte proliferation, microglial activation, or widespread 
      neurodegeneration. RESULTS: In the standard-dose SES group, the stent released 
      10.56% of the drug on day 1 and 95.41% on day 28 postimplantation. In the 
      high-dose SES group, corresponding figures were 40.20% on day 1 and 98.08% on day 
      28. Systemic drug concentration consistently remained below 1.5 ng/mL throughout 
      the study. Arterial tissue concentration reached its peak at day 28 days in the 
      standard-dose group and at 7 days in the high-dose group. Importantly, the brain 
      and related tissue concentrations remained below 0.4 µg/g in both standard-dose 
      and high-dose SES groups, peaking on day 21 in the standard-dose group and day 1 
      in the high-dose group. The detailed 180-day safety assessment revealed no 
      adverse effects on the brain, even at high sirolimus doses in the SES group. 
      CONCLUSION: This study provides robust evidence supporting the long-term 
      pharmacokinetic safety of SESs in the context of intracranial interventions for 
      high-grade intracranial atherosclerosis. The results adequately alleviate 
      concerns related to neurotoxicity and substantiate the feasibility of using these 
      stents as a therapeutic choice in neurosurgery.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus and impact of concomitant antiseizure 
      medications in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: A retrospective study of 
      therapeutic drug monitoring data in Denmark and Norway.

AB  - The mTOR-inhibitor everolimus is a precision drug with antiepileptogenic 
      properties approved for treatment of epilepsy in persons with tuberous sclerosis 
      complex (TSC) in combination with other antiseizure medications (ASMs). However, 
      the pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus is scarcely described, and the 
      available information on pharmacokinetic interactions is scarce. The purpose of 
      this study was to investigate pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus in 
      patients with TSC, and the impact of age, sex and comedication. In this 
      retrospective observational study we used anonymized data from medical records of 
      patients with TSC using everolimus in Norway and Denmark, 2012 to 2020. Long-term 
      therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) identified inter-patient and intra-patient 
      variability. The study included 59 patients, (36 females (61%)), median age 22 
      (range 3-59 years). Polytherapy was used in 50 patients (85%). The most 
      frequently used ASMs were lamotrigine (n = 21), valproate (n = 17), and 
      levetiracetam (n = 13). Blood concentrations of everolimus were measured in all 
      patients. Pharmacokinetic variability of everolimus between patients was 
      extensive, as demonstrated by a 24-fold variability from minimum-maximum 
      concentration/dose (C/D)-ratios. The coefficient of variation (CV) for 
      intra-patient (n = 59) and inter-patient variability (n = 47, ≥3 measurements) 
      was 40% and 43%, respectively. The C/D-ratio of everolimus was 50% lower in 13 
      patients (22%) using enzyme-inducing ASMs compared to the 30 patients who did not 
      (0.7 vs 1.4 ng/mL mg, P < .05). Age and sex were not significantly associated 
      with changes in C/D-ratios of everolimus. Long-term TDM identified extensive 
      variability in concentrations over time for everolimus both within and between 
      patients, where comedication with enzyme-inducing ASMs was an important 
      contributing factor. The findings suggest a need for TDM in patients with TSC 
      treated with everolimus.

TI  - Population pharmacokinetic study in children with vascular anomalies: body weight 
      as a key variable in predicting the initial dose and dosing frequency of 
      sirolimus.
PG  - 1457614
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2024.1457614 [doi]
LID - 1457614
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main challenges faced when using sirolimus in children with 
      vascular anomalies (VAs) still include significant pharmacokinetic (PK) 
      variability, uncertainty in the target concentration range, as well as 
      inconsistencies in initial dosing and dosing frequency. The aim of this study is 
      to establish a new population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model for children with VAs 
      to guide the individualized use of sirolimus. METHODS: A PPK study was performed 
      using data from children with VAs who received sirolimus between July 2017 and 
      April 2022. A nonlinear mixed-effect modeling with a one-compartment model 
      structure was applied. Monte Carlo simulation was employed to propose specific 
      dosing recommendations to achieve the target trough concentrations (C (trough)) 
      of 5-15 ng/mL. RESULTS: In total, 134 blood concentrations from 49 pediatric 
      patients were used to characterize the sirolimus pharmacokinetics. Covariate 
      analysis identified body weight (BW) as a significant factor affecting clearance 
      (CL) in the final PPK model. The typical clearance rate and distribution volume, 
      standardized to a BW of 16 kg, were 4.06 L/h (4% relative standard error, RSE) 
      and 155 L (26% RSE), respectively. Optimal dosing regimens were simulated for 
      different BWs. For a twice-daily regimen, the recommended doses were 0.05, 0.06, 
      0.07, and 0.08 mg/kg/day for BW of <10, 10-20, 20-40, and ≥40 kg, respectively; 
      for a once-daily regimen, the recommended doses were 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, and 
      0.09 mg/kg/day for BW of <10, 10-30, 30-50, and ≥50 kg, respectively. Notably, 
      sirolimus C (trough) could be maintained between 5-15 ng/mL across various dosing 
      frequencies based on the recommended dosing regimen. CONCLUSION: We established a 
      PPK model of sirolimus for children with VAs and proposed an initial dosing 
      strategy. Integrating initial dose and medication frequency recommendations into 
      sirolimus' guidelines will broaden its clinical options and simplify the clinical 
      management for childhood VAs.
